Abstract
82
265
Mammary development depends on branching morphogenesis, namely the bifurcation and extension of ductal growth points (end buds) and secretory lobules into a more or less fatty stroma.
266
492
Because breast carcinomas are overwhelmingly ductal in origin, this review focuses on stromal influences guiding postnatal ductal development and there is only the briefest account of the role of embryonic stroma (mesenchyme).
493
712
The stroma as the necessary target for endocrine mammogens and the source of stimulatory growth factors is described and the importance of mammary epithelium-induced modifications of the periductal stroma is emphasized.
713
915
Evidence is presented that if they are to grow, end buds must condition proximal fatty stroma by recruiting white blood cells as well as inducing stromal cell division and, possibly, estrogen receptors.
916
1109
The induction of a fibrous stromal tunic around the end bud is described and its likely role as a complex ductal morphogen is discussed; a possible role in growth inhibition is also considered.
1110
1292
Although the signals governing fibrotic induction, ductal morphogenesis, and growth inhibition are unknown, a role for transforming growth factor-β is highly likely and is discussed.
1293
1415
Finally, a need for new conceptual and experimental approaches to understanding stromal-epithelial signaling is discussed.

Introduction
1431
1505
Mammary gland development occurs in two morphogenetically distinct phases.
1506
1681
The first begins with the differentiation of a mammary ductal rudiment from the embryonic epidermis and ends after puberty with an elegant arborated system of ducts (Fig. 1a).
1682
1793
In the second phase, beginning with pregnancy, acinar milk-secretory lobules develop on this primary framework.
1794
2034
This review focuses on organotypic branching morphogenesis as it occurs during the ductal, as opposed to the lobular, phase, because it is during ductal development that stromal influences are demonstrably the most crucial to organogenesis.
2035
2266
In addition, more than 90% of human mammary carcinomas are ductal in origin and it is becoming increasingly clear that the subversion of reciprocal signals between parenchyma and stroma are an important aspect of tumor progression.
2267
2505
Finally, although reference will be made to the influence of the embryonic stroma, called the mesenchyme, on mammary development, the emphasis will be on postnatal events because these arguably have a more direct bearing on breast cancer.
2508
2551
Mammary ducts grow through a complex stroma
2553
2639
By parturition, the mammary stroma comprises multiple cellular and acellular elements.
2640
2878
In the mouse, which is the most thoroughly studied model and the focus of this review, adipocytes are the most abundant cell type, followed by fibroblasts, various migratory blood cells, endothelial cells (blood vessels), and nerve cells.
2879
3173
Acellular elements include fibrous and non-fibrous collagens, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins, all of which provide mechanical support to the tissue as well as forming a dynamic, developmentally active extracellular matrix/basal lamina complex at the epithelial-stromal boundary (Fig. 1b) [1].
3174
3420
This complex connective tissue is found in the mammary glands of different species with various ratios of fibrous to fatty elements [2], and it is within this matrix that mammary ducts elongate, arborate, and, finally, terminate growth (Fig. 1a).
3423
3558
The mammary gland pictured (Fig. 1) is a snapshot of the situation in adolescence, roughly midway in the ductal phase of organogenesis.
3559
3715
End buds, the highly mitotic ductal growth points (Fig. 2a), are in the process of elongating by penetrating the fatty stroma; some can be seen bifurcating.
3716
3911
Others that are approaching the edge of the fat pad (at the right of the image) are in various stages of terminating (getting smaller) or have ceased to grow altogether (blunt-tipped structures).
3912
4061
During this period of maximum ductal elongation, more than 95% of the gland is growth-quiescent, maintaining the open spaces between ducts (Fig. 1a).
4062
4151
A prominent, epithelium-induced modification of the periductal stroma is also noteworthy.
4152
4335
Type I collagen-rich fibrous connective tissue begins to ensheath the end bud on its flank, roughly at the point in which it begins to constrict to ductal dimensions (Figs 1b and 2a).
4336
4483
This sheath, which also comprises the basal-lamina/extracellular matrix complex, is retained and forms a fibrous sleeve around the subtending duct.
4486
4758
At this point in its development, then, the signature features of the gland are the following: (1) ductal as opposed to lobular morphology; (2) large, open spaces between ducts; (3) most active growth focused in end buds; (4) regressed end buds at the edge of the fat pad.
4759
4888
A role for the stroma in defining each of these glandular features is supported by experimental evidence that is discussed below.
4891
5060
In seminal experiments by Kratochwil and Sakakura, mammary parenchyma was shown to possess a developmental plasticity that is constrained and directed by the stroma [3].
5061
5239
When Kratochwil cultured a composite of embryonic mammary epithelium and embryonic sub-mandibular (salivary) mesenchyme, the mammary tissue developed salivary gland-like lobules.
5240
5411
Extending these experiments in vivo, Sakakura demonstrated that not only embryonic but also adult mammary tissue could respond in this way to salivary mesenchymal signals.
5412
5610
Importantly, the instructive properties of the stroma did not extend to cytodifferentiation: in a pregnant host animal, salivary-like mammary transplants synthesized the milk protein α-lactal-bumin.
5611
5819
Interestingly, fetal mammary mesenchyme grafted into the adult gland accelerated tumorigenesis, providing an early indication that modifications of stromal signaling could influence the progress of neoplasia.
5822
5964
The absence of extensive ductal side branching and infilling of interductal spaces is not due to the terminal differentiation of ductal cells.
5965
6167
Even the smallest fragment of a duct, when transplanted to stroma devoid of parenchyma, undergoes aggressive growth and can fill a fat pad with a morphologically and functionally complete ductal system.
6168
6300
This capacity is attributed to up to three populations of mammary stem or progenitor cells [4] and is subject to stromal inhibition.
6301
6446
When similar fragments are transplanted into a space between existing ducts the graft is maintained but does not grow (Daniel, unpublished data).
6447
6688
Normal inhibition of ductal branching must therefore overcome a stromal background that is strongly stimulatory; there is now excellent evidence that transforming growth factor-βs (TGF-βs), acting in part on stromal targets, are responsible.
6691
7032
The rapid and reversible inhibition of end bud growth by experimentally implanted TGF-β1 demonstrates the mammotrophic activity of this growth factor, whereas its normally high concentration in the periductal extracellular matrix and its localized loss over lateral buds strongly implies an action that modulates secondary ductal growth [5].
7033
7205
Studies with transgenic mice overexpressing a constitutively activated form of TGF-β1 [6], as well as function-ablating mutant TGF-β signaling receptors, were confirmatory.
7206
7386
The ectopic expression of TGF-β1 resulted in a significant decrease in lateral branching, and mutant TGF-β receptors expressed in the stroma increased lateral branch infilling [7].
7387
7543
Because the latter are an important site of TGF-β action, normal chronic inhibition of branching must depend, in part, on TGF-β-regulated secondary signals.
7544
7743
Recently, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which can stimulate the branching of mammary epithelial tubes in vitro and is negatively modulated by TGF-β, has emerged as a candidate secondary signal [8].
7744
7875
In this model, TGF-β inhibits branching through the inhibition of HGF expression in the periductal stroma (reviewed in this issue).
7876
8056
However, the protean effects of TGF-βs on mitogenesis and extracellular matrix dynamics in mammary tissue make the assignment of any single, TGF-β-mediated mechanism premature [5].
8059
8158
Ductal elongation and branching depend on parenchyma-induced modifications of the periductal stroma
8160
8236
It is striking that ductal growth is so exquisitely focused in the end buds.
8237
8347
The impression that precisely localized, as opposed to general, signals guide this development is unavoidable.
8348
8501
In fact, this impression is correct and epithelium-induced changes develop the growth-promoting potential of the stroma immediately in front of end buds.
8502
8745
Exciting new evidence demonstrates that migratory white blood cells, macrophages and eosinophils, are drawn to the vicinity of the end bud by chemoattractants and, surprisingly, prove to be essential for the normal development of end buds [9].
8746
8977
Interestingly, extensive DNA synthesis in the stroma around end buds accompanies this activity, indicating that new stromal cells are not only recruited to the vicinity of the end bud but are also induced by it to proliferate [10].
8978
9158
The absence of stromal DNA synthesis around growth-terminated ducts emphasizes that these inductive signals are growth-related and are not due merely to the presence of epithelium.
9161
9433
Steroid autoradiographic experiments have demonstrated that estrogen receptors are concentrated in the nuclei of stromal cells around end buds but not in rapidly dividing cap cells (a stem cell layer covering the tip of the end bud), indicating a paracrine mechanism [11].
9434
9580
This was confirmed when estrogen receptor knockout (ERKO) mice were used to investigate whether the steroid acts on epithelial or stromal targets.
9581
9895
Cunha et al [12] surgically transplanted ERKO epithelium in combination with either ERKO or wild-type stroma under renal capsules in athymic mice and demonstrated that, whereas wild-type stroma supported organotypic growth of the ERKO epithelium, no ductal growth was seen with wild-type epithelium in ERKO stroma.
9896
10227
It has been suggested that estrogen receptors are uniquely concentrated around end buds, but this has not been proved [11], leaving open the possibilities that elongating ducts stimulate the induction of estrogen receptors in nearby stromal cells, attract estrogen receptor-positive stromal cells, or stimulate their proliferation.
10228
10364
In addition to estrogen, other ductal mammogens act through intermediaries generated in the stroma (reviewed in this issue and in [13]).
10365
10504
These include epidermal growth factor, activins/inhibins, and growth hormone, which stimulates the synthesis of insulin-like growth factor.
10505
10593
Growth stimulatory stromal-epithelial interactions are shown diagrammatically in Fig. 3.
10596
10733
Organotypic development depends on two obvious structural modifications of the end bud, its constriction into a tube and its bifurcation.
10734
10959
Preceding either, there is focal induction by the end bud of type I collagen-rich connective tissue and extracellular matrix on its flank (Fig. 1b) and in the clefts that indent the tip when two new end buds form (not shown).
10960
11021
An active role for collagen in shaping the duct is indicated.
11022
11232
In vitro, mammary epithelial cells embedded in collagen gels form narrow tubules that are also seen in vivo when fragments of duct form similar tubules in a bolus of injected type 1 collagen (reviewed in [13]).
11233
11447
Mechanistically, by binding to members of the integrin family of extracellular matrix receptors, collagen can stimulate the formation of actin-cytoskeletal foci that are capable of changing mammary cell shape [14].
11448
11716
Indeed, β1-integrin was localized at the basal surfaces of the end bud epithelium, and function-blocking antibodies against β-integrin, as well as antibodies against laminin, reversibly inhibited end bud development in vivo, while blocking tubulogenesis in vitro [15].
11719
11846
The molecular signals governing the sites of fibrous induction are largely unknown; however, TGF-βs seem likely to have a role.
11847
12026
The experimental release of TGF-β1 in the vicinity of an end bud by plastic implants caused epithelium-dependent induction of a fibrous connective tissue cap over the end bud tip.
12027
12242
The molecular composition of this cap reflected that of the fibrous connective tissue on the flank of the end bud and in developing clefts before bifurcation, suggesting that TGF-β1 might be the normal inducer [16].
12245
12363
More recently, parathyroid-hormone-related protein (PTHrP) has been shown to be crucial for normal ductal development.
12364
12472
Transgenic animals overexpressing the peptide show severe impairment of ductal extension and branching [17].
12473
12707
Pertinent to this discussion, PTHrP synthesis is concentrated in the cap cells of end buds and their myoepithelial descendents on the flank, whereas cognate receptors seem to be concentrated in the immediately adjacent fibrous tissue.
12708
12761
This indicates a potential role in stromal induction.
12762
12929
With this in mind, the fact that TGF-β can positively regulate PTHrP is interesting [17] because TGF-β is present, often at high levels, in the end bud [18] (Fig. 3b).
12930
13195
These observations suggest that TGF-βs might indirectly cause the induction of the fibrous sheath of end buds and that experiments to investigate whether PTHrP induces fibrosis and whether TGF-β1 normally regulates PTHrP during ductal development would be fruitful.
13198
13327
A combined role for TGF-β-induced fibrous stroma in inhibiting end bud growth while guiding morphogenesis has been suggested [5].
13328
13526
Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that fibrous connective tissue on the flank progressively advances to envelop the tips of end buds that are in the process of stopping growth [19].
13527
13685
Arguing against the matrix as a primary growth inhibitor, however, implanted TGF-β inhibits DNA synthesis up to 12 h before the appearance of the fibrous cap.
13686
13848
Furthermore, surprisingly high levels of DNA synthesis can be detected in matrix-ensheathed, growth-quiescent ducts, some quite distant from the end bud (Fig. 2).
13849
14055
Although this DNA synthesis might or might not be related to mitosis [20], it nevertheless demonstrates that growth-stimulatory signals can be quite active in ducts beneath an intact fibrous stromal sheath.
14056
14280
Even though it is clear that stromal signals must ultimately inhibit end bud growth [how else can their regression before reaching the limits of the fat pad be explained (Fig. 1a)?], their identity remains unknown (Fig. 3b).
14283
14332
Resolving signaling between epithelium and stroma
14334
14581
During the past decade, classic mammary tissue recombination experiments have been recalled to duty, this time using tissue from genetically engineered mice, and have led to important insights into the stromal origins of ductal mammogenic signals.
14582
14830
Much less is known about the epithelial signals that reorganize the periductal stroma and, as I have discussed briefly above, these retrograde signals are crucial to the realization of the morphogenetic and growth-promoting potential of the stroma.
14833
15096
Identifying the relevant epithelial signals and placing them in a proper temporal order with regard to the elicitation of stromal signals and the ensuing morphogenetic events is now a major challenge that will require new conceptual as well as experimental tools.
15097
15418
The strong evolutionary conservation of reciprocal, epithelial-stromal signaling in branching morphogenesis, which encompasses the development of branched airways from insects to mammals, for example, suggests that careful study of these systems could provide new ideas pertinent to mammary growth and morphogenesis [21].
15421
15431
Conclusion
15433
15690
In an earlier review [13] I suggested that bringing modern molecular methods to bear to investigate the dynamics of gene expression in the stroma and epithelium at obvious growth and morphogenetic inflection points (eg in front of end buds) would be useful.
15691
15949
However, this approach does not address the vital issue of the temporal order of signaling, the resolution of which would benefit from a 'time-zero' experimental condition, in which growth-static mammary ducts could be induced to grow in a controlled manner.
15950
16056
Although there should be several ways of accomplishing this, simple ductal transplants come first to mind.
16057
16326
Through an analysis of the initiation and earliest phases of transplant outgrowth over a finely spaced time-course, it might be possible to obtain an orderly reading of reciprocal epithelial and stromal signals that underlie stromal reorganization and ductal extension.

Endocrine mammogens [estrogen (E), growth hormone (GH)], acting on stromal targets in front of the end bud, stimulate the synthesis of the local mammogens epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and members of the activin/inhibin family.

In a purely speculative model for fibrous induction, TGF-β, acting in a paracrine mode on cap/myoepithelial cells (black layer), induces parathyroid-hormone-related protein (P).
19093
19203
Secreted parathyroid-hormone-related protein then acts on stromal targets, inducing highly localized fibrosis.
19204
19286
Finally, along the duct, TGF-β1 inhibits lateral branching by blocking HGF action.
