Abstract
52
156
Tissue factor (TF) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and the main triggering element of blood coagulation.
157
334
TF expression on monocytes and endothelial cells is induced by exposure to endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-1 and is considered to appear in consequence of inflammation.
335
489
In order to assess the proinflammatory capacity of TF itself, the recombinant extracellular domain of TF was injected intra-articularly into healthy mice.
490
626
To characterize the role of immune cells in the TF-induced arthritis, mice deprived of lymphocytes, neutrophils and monocytes were used.
627
825
Histomorphological analysis of the joints with respect to inflammatory cell infiltration, pannus formation and erosion formation revealed development of arthritis in 80% of animals injected with TF.
826
932
In most of the cases synovial proliferation was accompanied by pannus formation and cartilage destruction.
933
997
Inflammatory cell infiltrate consisted of CD4-Mac1+ macrophages.
998
1070
Depletion of monocytes was, however, not enough to abolish inflammation.
1071
1195
Indeed, combined deficiency of monocytes and lymphocytes was required to prevent inflammation following the injection of TF.
1196
1353
We observed that TF induced chemokine production (MIP-1α and RANTES), but did not induce a proliferative response nor cytokine release by mouse spleen cells.
1354
1463
TF has strong inflammatogenic properties mediated predominantly by monocytes and their release of chemokines.
1464
1550
Our study shows that TF can simultaneously trigger the immune and coagulation systems.

Introduction
1566
1669
Tissue factor (TF) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and the major cellular trigger of blood coagulation.
1670
1752
Assembly of a complex between TF and factor VII (FVII) initiates fibrin formation.
1753
1944
Besides its role in blood coagulation, TF is also important for the vascular development regulating embryonic angiogenesis and supporting proliferative and invasive capacities of cells [1-4].
1945
2209
Expression of TF on the cell surface and its appearance as a soluble molecule are characteristic features of acute and chronic inflammation in conditions such as sepsis, atherosclerosis, Crohn's desease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rejection reactions [5-9].
2212
2281
The role of TF in the inflammatory process is a matter of discussion.
2282
2510
A variety of inflammatory stimuli, including mitogens, bacterial cell products, components of the complement system and cytokines, are known to promote the expression of TF on the surface of endothelial cells and monocytes [10].
2511
2641
T cells regulate TF expression: upregulation is achieved by Th1 cytokines, while Th2-derived cytokines are mostly inhibitory [11].
2642
2764
TF, in turn, may participate in cellular interactions promoting leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration [12,13].
2767
2922
In the present study we investigated the capacity of TF to induce inflammation by injecting human recombinant TF (rTF) into joint cavities of healthy mice.
2923
3135
Histomorphological investigation of the injected joints showed a remarkable cellular infiltration of synovia and occasionally cartilage destruction, indicating that TF possesses strong proinflammatory properties.
3136
3262
Expression of TF on monocytes and synovial cells may be crucial for potentiating the initial stages of inflammation in joints.
3265
3286
Materials and methods
3288
3354
BALB/c and NMRI mice were purchased from ALAB (Stockholm, Sweden).
3355
3476
Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice and their congenic strain CB17 were purchased from M&B (Bomholtvej, Denmark).
3477
3579
All mice were housed in the animal facility of the Department of Rheumatology, University of Göteborg.
3580
3642
Female mice 6–8 weeks of age were used in all the experiments.
3645
3839
This version of rTF contains the extracellular domain of human TF, amino acid residues 1–219 [14], which retains the ability to bind to FVII and FVIIa and to enhance enzymatic activity of FVIIa.
3840
3985
rTF preparation was dissolved in Hepes buffered saline (Hepes 30 mM, NaCl 100 mM, 0.02% Na-azide; pH7.5) and kept in aliquots at -70°C until use.
3986
4099
Two preparations of TF were used that contained 3.7 μg/ml and 32 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively.
4100
4224
No significant difference in the results obtained with these two preparations was observed and the results were thus pooled.
4227
4297
NMRI strain mice were used in the experiments unless stated otherwise.
4298
4420
Induction of arthritis was performed by injection of rTF in a volume of 20 μl intra-articularly into the right knee joint.
4421
4568
Control experiments were performed by injecting an equivalent amount of LPS preparation in Hepes buffered saline into the contralateral knee joint.
4571
4828
Neutrophil depletion was performed by intraperitoneal injection of the monoclonal antibody RB6-8C5 (hybridoma was kindly provided by Dr R Coffman, DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA, USA) two hours before the rTF injection, as described previously [15].
4829
5011
The IgG rat antiovalbumin monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr E Telemo, Department of Clinical Immunology, University of Göteborg, Sweden) was injected into the control group.
5012
5256
Monocyte depletion was induced by subcutaneous injection of etoposide (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Bromma, Sweden; 12.5 mg/kg body weight, in a volume of 100 μl [16]) on three consecutive days before and three consecutive days after injection of rTF.
5257
5387
The impact of lymphocytes was studied by injecting rTF into SCID mice lacking B and T lymphocytes and their congenic strain, CB17.
5390
5642
This was achieved by using mini-osmotic pumps (model 2002, Alza Corp, Palo Alto, CA, USA) filled with buffered solution containing 200 U/ml ancrod (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO, USA) implanted subcutaneously three days before the injection of rTF [17].
5645
5764
Histological examination of joints was done after paraffin embedding, cutting, and staining with hematoxylin and eosin.
5765
5813
All the slides were coded and evaluated blindly.
5814
6016
The specimens were evaluated with respect to occurrence of synovial hypertrophy, inflammatory cells in synovial sublining compartment, pannus formation and cartilage and/or subchondral bone destruction.
6017
6106
Intensity of synovial inflammation (arthritis index) was graded arbitrarily from 0 to 3. 
6108
6210
For immunohistochemical examination, the knee joints were removed and demineralized as described [18].
6211
6352
Serial cryosections of 6 μm thickness were stained with rat monoclonal antibodies directed against mouse CD11b (Mac-1; M 1/70) or CD4 (GK1.5)
6353
6535
(both antibodies from PharMingen, San Diego, CA, USA), then incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (DAKO A/S, Gosulp, Denmark) and avidin-biotin-peroxidase complexes (ABC).
6536
6594
All sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin.
6597
6840
Murine splenocyte suspension (cell density 2 × 106/ml) in Iscove's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 nM L-glutamine, mercaptoethanol and 50 μg/ml gentamicin was stimulated with rTF at a final concentration of 0.1–10 μg/ml.
6841
6944
At defined time points, supernatants were collected for determination of cytokine and chemokine levels.
6947
7234
Proliferation was determined by the incorporation of [3H]-thymidine (specific activity, 42 Ci/mmol; Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, UK) into splenocyte suspension (cell density 4 × 105/ml), stimulated for 72 hours with either rTF or LPS at a final concentration of 0.1–10 μg/ml.
7235
7332
The results were expressed as a stimulation index (counts per minute, mean ± standard deviation).
7335
7526
The level of interleukin (IL)-6 in the rTF-stimulated supernatants was determined by a bioassay measuring the effect of test samples on the growth of the IL-6-dependent cell line B13.29 [19].
7527
7723
The results were analyzed by incorporation of [3H]-thymidine after 72 hours stimulation and compared to results with the standard dilutions of recombinant mouse IL-6 (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA).
7726
7992
The levels of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted) were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using Quantikine M kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and expressed in pg/ml.
7995
8145
The differences in the incidence and the severity of arthritis in the groups were analyzed by the Fisher's test and Mann–Whitney U test, respectively.
8148
8155
Results
8157
8324
The ability of rTF to induce arthritis was evaluated by injection of rTF in the doses 0.2, 2.0, and 20 μg (0.004, 0.04, and 0.4 nmol) into the knee joint of NMRI mice.
8325
8511
Four days after the inoculation, morphological signs of arthritis (synovial tissue hypertrophy, and inflammatory cell infiltrates) were found in 33%, 56% and 83% of joints, respectively.
8512
8683
Control mice injected with the amount of LPS equivalent to its concentration in the rTF preparation exhibited arthritis only in 28% of cases (13/15 versus 4/14; P < 0.01).
8684
8845
The arthritis index of the rTF-induced arthritis was significantly higher in joints injected with 20 μg of rTF than in the controls (1.73 versus 0.23; P < 0.01).
8846
9081
Moreover, 6/13 joints injected with 20 μg of rTF developed extrasynovial features of arthritis (pannus formation, n = 2; cartilage destruction, n = 3 and periarticular bone destruction, n = 1) compared to only one in the control group.
9082
9151
In all further experiments the dose of 20 μg of TF per knee was used.
9154
9263
Dynamics of rTF-induced arthritis were assessed morphologically on days 4, 14 and 60 after the rTF injection.
9264
9464
The highest frequency of arthritis and severity of inflammation was observed on day 4 after injection and it diminished significantly by days 14 and 60 (13/15 versus 2/8 and 2/6, P < 0.05; Fig. 1a,b).
9465
9587
Notably, erosion and/or pannus formation were always found in cases of long lasting arthritis but in none of the controls.
9590
9650
Sensitivity to rTF varied between the healthy mouse strains.
9651
9857
Four days after the injection of rTF (20 μg/knee) into NMRI (n = 15), CB17 (n = 8) and BALB/c mice (n = 8), morphological signs of arthritis were registered in 80%, 75% and 50% of knee joints, respectively.
9858
9981
These results indicate that susceptibility to inflammatory potential of rTF is dependent on genetic background of the host.
9984
10115
Immunochemical staining of joint sections revealed dense infiltrates consisting of Mac-1+ mononuclear cells in the synovial tissue.
10116
10202
In contrast, all the sections were negative for staining with CD4-specific antibodies.
10203
10386
This allowed us to conclude that the inflammatory infiltrate observed after the injection of rTF consisted predominantly of macrophages accompanied by few if any neutrophils (Fig. 2).
10389
10525
To evaluate the role of different immune cells in the development of rTF-induced inflammation, cell depletion procedures were performed.
10526
10734
Mice pretreated with lysing antineutrophil antibodies showed no reduction in the frequency or intensity of arthritis compared to controls that received antiovalbumin antibodies (5/8 versus 7/8, respectively).
10735
10954
Mice injected with etoposide, and thereby deprived of monocyte/macrophage cell population, demonstrated a tendency to a reduction in frequency but not the severity of arthritis (6/8 versus 4/7; not significant; Fig. 3).
10955
11167
Intra-articular injection of rTF into SCID mice deficient for T- and B-lymphocytes revealed no difference in the frequency of arthritis compared to congenic CB17 mice strain (11/15 versus 12/15, not significant).
11168
11342
The results of experiments indicated that isolated depletion of neither monocyte nor lymphocyte cell populations was enough to abolish the induction of rTF-induced arthritis.
11343
11540
To test if a combined lymphocyte and monocyte cell depletion was efficient in prevention of rTF-induced cell infiltration, SCID mice treated with etoposide were intra-articularly injected with rTF.
11541
11782
Only one of seven mice in this group developed arthritis in response to injection of rTF, demonstrating that interaction between macrophages and lymphocytes is essential for cellular infiltration of synovium following rTF injection (Fig. 3).
11785
11924
Systemic depletion of fibrinogen with ancrod prior to rTF injection did not reduce the incidence of rTF-induced arthritis in 6/8 NMRI mice.
11927
12062
Effects of rTF on lymphoid cells were investigated by incubating mouse splenocytes with rTF (0.1 μg/ml, 1 μg/ml, 5 μg/ml, or 10 μg/ml).
12063
12231
Investigation of supernatants after 48 hours of stimulation for the level of IL-6, RANTES, and MIP-1α demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in the level of chemokines.
12232
12457
The increase was pronounced for MIP-1α (73 ± 33 pg/ml in non-stimulated cells versus 139 ± 32 pg/ml after stimulation with 5 μg/ml of rTF; n = 3) but was only marginal for RANTES (256 ± 46 pg/ml versus 365 ± 32 pg/ml; n = 3).
12458
12553
In contrast, neither change in the level of IL-6 nor proliferation of lymphocytes was observed.
12556
12566
Discussion
12568
12635
Inflammation and thrombosis are linked in many clinical conditions.
12636
12933
It is presumed that proinflammatory mediators potentiate activation of blood coagulation and serine proteases of the coagulation system, especially the terminal enzyme thrombin, known for proinflammatory and mitogenic/chemotactic effects both in circulation and locally in synovial tissue [20-22].
12934
13146
An indication of the importance of TF in the inflammatory process was obtained in the animal model of sepsis, in which TF-dependent procoagulant activity correlated with the level of tumor necrosis factor-α [23].
13147
13397
In addition, modulation of TF-dependent coagulation by administration of either TF-pathway inhibitor or anti-TF antibodies decreased circulating levels of IL-6 and IL-8 [24,25], and diminished proliferation and perivascular cell infiltration [26,27].
13398
13499
This study shows that the TF molecule possesses strong proinflammatory properties, causing arthritis.
13500
13612
Histological analysis revealed that TF-induced synovitis could be attributed mostly to infiltrating macrophages.
13613
13763
Mononuclear cell influx into synovia is an early finding in the majority of asymptomatic subjects, preceding clinically overt arthritis in RA [28,29].
13764
13936
Furthermore, synovial macrophage infiltration is a characteristic feature of both autoimmune and bacterial arthritis [30,31] and is a determinant of joint erosions [32,33].
13937
14202
Our observation, in combination with an increased TF-dependent procoagulant activity in blood and synovial fluid of patients with RA, implies participation of TF in triggering the initial steps of inflammation during RA and/or in rendering the inflammation chronic.
14205
14396
Composition of inflammatory infiltrate and cell depletion studies showed that TF exerts its proinflammatory properties in a cell-specific manner targeting the macrophage/ monocyte population.
14397
14570
This is not surprising taking into consideration that macrophages/monocytes are the only cells in the blood circulation compartment which express TF on their surface [8,34].
14571
14698
Moreover, we demonstrated that an interaction between monocytes and lymphocytes was a prerequisite of the TF-induced arthritis.
14699
14804
Activated T cells were able to induce TF production by stimulating monocytes through CD40 ligand [35,36].
14805
14911
This mechanism may contribute to a positive feedback essential for maintenance of TF-induced inflammation.
14912
15128
Interestingly, neutrophils, other principal inflammatory cells, were not sensitive to TF stimulation – these cells were neither found in synovial tissues nor affected arthritis frequency in the depletion experiments.
15131
15228
Mononuclear cells composing the inflammatory infiltrate in synovia were mostly Mac-1+ CD4- cells.
15229
15378
Abundant expression of Mac-1 molecule on the monocyte surface indicates a principal role of β2-integrins in cell activation following exposure to TF.
15379
15428
Two methods of such activation may be considered.
15429
15544
TF may attract Mac-1+ cells indirectly by increasing formation of coagulation proteins known as Mac-1 ligands, e.g.
15545
15569
Factor X and fibrinogen.
15570
15703
However, the high incidence of TF-induced arthritis in defibrinated mice favors a direct stimulatory effect of TF on sensitive cells.
15704
15895
Treatment of macrophages with TF in vitro has been shown to increase the expression of β2-chain-containing adhesion molecules [37] and supports the idea of direct TF-induced Mac-1 expression.
15896
16242
Lack of CD4+ cells responsible for peptide presentation through MHC class II molecules shows that this mechanism is not compulsory for TF-induced synovial infiltration, in contrast to experimental glomerulonephritis where simultaneous expression of TF and MHC class II molecules was observed and efficiently blocked by anti-TF antibodies [38,39].
16245
16305
The way in which TF interacts with macrophages is not clear.
16306
16401
Exposure of spleen cell cultures to TF did not induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines.
16402
16522
These results favor the suggestion that TF acts directly on inflammatory cells and not by a cytokine-mediated mechanism.
16523
16681
TF-mediated release of chemoattractant molecules, which recruit inflammatory cells from the circulation or surrounding tissues, is an alternative possibility.
16682
16822
We found that in vitro splenocyte stimulation with TF was associated with selective release of the monocyte chemoattractant molecule MIP-1α.
16823
16959
This observation may explain the dominance of mononuclear cells in the synovial inflammatory infiltrates of the joints injected with TF.
16962
17133
Altogether our observations suggest that TF may play an active role during arthritis by direct and/or indirect stimulation of influx of monocytes into the synovial tissue.
