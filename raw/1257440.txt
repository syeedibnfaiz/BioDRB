Abstract
107
244
Sex hormones seem to modulate the immune/inflammatory responses by different mechanisms in female and male rheumatoid arthritis patients.
245
460
The effects of 17β-oestradiol and of testosterone were tested on the cultured human monocytic/macrophage cell line (THP-1) activated with IFN-γ in order to investigate their role in cell proliferation and apoptosis.
461
583
Activated human THP-1 cells were cultured in the presence of 17β-oestradiol and testosterone (final concentration, 10 nM).
584
787
The evaluation of markers of cell proliferation included the NF-κB DNA-binding assay, the NF-κB inhibition complex, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and the methyl-tetrazolium salt test.
788
901
Apoptosis was detected by the annexin V-propidium assay and by the cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase expression.
902
1016
Specific methods included flow analysis cytometry scatter analysis, immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis.
1017
1114
Cell growth inhibition and increased apoptosis were observed in testosterone-treated THP-1 cells.
1115
1369
Increased poly-ADP ribose polymerase-cleaved expression and decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, as well as an increase of IκB-α and a decrease of the IκB-α phosphorylated form (ser 32), were found in testosterone-treated THP-1 cells.
1370
1459
However, the NF-κB DNA binding was found increased in 17β-oestradiol-treated THP-1 cells.
1460
1625
The treatment with staurosporine (enhancer of apoptosis) induced decreased NF-κB DNA binding in all conditions, but particularly in testosterone-treated THP-1 cells.
1626
1717
Treatment of THP-1 by sex hormones was found to influence cell proliferation and apoptosis.
1718
1870
Androgens were found to increase the apoptosis, and oestrogens showed a protective trend on cell death – both acting as modulators of the NF-κB complex.
1872
1884
Introduction
1886
2099
Experimental and clinical evidence indicates that immune reactivity is greater in females than in males and suggests that gonadal steroids may play an important role in the regulation of the immune response [1-4].
2100
2281
Indeed, many cells of the immune system have been found to possess functional sex hormone receptors, such as CD8-positive T cells, B cells and, notably, monocytes/macrophages [5,6].
2284
2457
Therefore, 17β-oestradiol (E2) was found to inhibit cellular apoptosis, to increase antibody production by B cells and to exert dose-related effects on T-cell functions [7].
2458
2537
Androgens seem to exert effects opposite to those of E2 on immune response [8].
2538
2676
Clinical epidemiology clearly confirms a higher prevalence of autoimmune diseases in female subjects when compared with male subjects [9].
2679
2921
The studies concerning the functional interaction between the NF-κB pathway and members of the steroid hormone receptor family, and their role in synovial inflammation, have advanced significantly, although with controversial results [10,11].
2922
3105
In particular, after binding with E2, oestrogen receptors have been shown to interact with NF-κB factors, via transcriptional co-factors, resulting in mutual or non-mutual antagonism.
3106
3387
Other studies hypothesize that, since oestrogen receptors may repress both constitutive and inducible NF-κB activity, the overexpression of NF-κB-inducible genes in oestrogen receptor-negative cells might contribute to malignant cell growth and chemotherapeutic resistance [12,13].
3388
3499
On the contrary, further studies report that E2 blocks the transcriptional activity of p65 in macrophages [14].
3500
3658
However, these opposite observations arise using different cell lines (human/animals) and culture conditions as well as different hormone concentrations [15].
3659
3927
In addition, multiple mechanisms concerning the interaction between oestrogen receptors and NF-κB have been proposed, such as repression of NF-κB DNA binding by physical association with oestrogen receptors and the regulation of IκB-α expression by oestrogens [16,17].
3930
4060
The androgen receptor seems to be closely related to the glucocorticoid receptor in terms of both structure and sequence homology.
4061
4378
The androgen receptor and the glucocorticoid receptor have been shown to interact and repress activator protein 1 via a similar mechanism; consequently, it would not be surprising that the androgen receptor might also interact with NF-κB in a manner very similar to that observed for the glucocorticoid receptor [18].
4379
4541
Both the androgen receptor and NF-κB are inducible transcription factors with some opposing functions in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses [19].
4544
4782
It is possible that inflammatory agents that activate NF-κB in vivo may interfere with normal androgen signalling, and recent studies indicate that the androgen receptor and NF-κB (subunit p65) are mutual transcriptional antagonists [20].
4783
5039
The present study was therefore undertaken to examine the long-term (time course of 7 days) effects of sex hormones on activated cultured human monocytic/macrophage cell line (THP-1) cells by investigating their effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis.
5040
5233
These cells are equipped with functional sex hormone receptors and are an important target of sex steroid hormones, particularly in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [21].
5234
5469
In particular, in the present study we used pharmacological concentrations of E2 (final concentration, 10 nM; Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) that have been already described as the most efficient in stimulating macrophages in vitro [22].
5470
5542
Accordingly, the same concentration has been used for testosterone [23].
5545
5688
We therefore investigated sex hormone effects on the NF-κB pathway, as a complex of molecules modulating cellular responses in activated cells.

Materials and methods
5714
5925
THP-1 cells (Interlab cell line collection HTL097014; IST c/o CBA, Genoa, Italy) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 2% foetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) (5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37°C).
5926
6125
Moreover, the absence of binding of the hormones with other foetal bovine serum components related to growth rate and the survival of cultured THP-1 cells over the course of 7 days were investigated.
6126
6200
The cells were maintained in logarithmic growth by passage every 3–4 days.
6201
6287
The viability of the cells (97–98%) was tested by the Trypan blue exclusion procedure.
6288
6481
Briefly, the cells were seeded into six-well flat-bottom plates (106 cells/well) and were treated with 500 U/ml IFN-γ (Sigma-Aldrich) in order to differentiate THP-1 into macrophage cells [24].
6482
6623
The activation and transformation of the cells was evaluated by the expression of different macrophage antigens: CD68, CD14, HAM 56, Mac 387.
6624
6736
The THP-1 activated cells were then incubated for 24, 48, 72, 96 and 168 hours with E2 and testosterone (10 nM).
6739
6879
After that time samples of THP-1 cells were also treated with an apoptosis inducer [25], staurosporine (17 nM; Sigma Aldrich), for 24 hours.
6880
7092
At the end of the different incubation times, the cells were harvested, washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and treated with different lysis buffers for the nuclear and total protein extraction.
7093
7260
Part of the cell was then collected for DNA content (normal and apoptotic) evaluation by flow analysis cytometry scatter analysis and for immunocytochemistry analysis.
7263
7466
The immunocytochemistry analysis to evaluate the expression of CD68, CD14, HAM56 and Mac387 in the treated cells showed positive results (data not shown), confirming the activation of monocytes by IFN-γ.
7469
7648
The cell growth was evaluated at different times by the methyl-tetrazolium salt test, which represents a quantitative colorimetric assay to detect cell survival and proliferation.
7649
7765
The test is based on the ability of living cells to cleave the tetrazolium ring at the level of active mitochondria.
7766
7882
Briefly, the cells were seeded into 96-well microtitre plates and were treated according to the experimental design.
7883
8105
At the established time, 50 μl methyl-tetrazolium salt labelling reagent [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 5 mg/ml in PBS] was added to each well and incubated in humidified atmosphere at 37°C.
8106
8201
Four hours later, 100 μl dimethylsulfoxide were introduced into each well and mixed thoroughly.
8202
8288
The absorbance was calculated at 540 nm, using a scanning multiwell spectrophotometer.
8289
8445
Standard curves were constructed for THP-1 cells using known plating densities, allowing the cell number to be calculated from this optical density reading.
8446
8490
Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
8493
8850
The apoptotic events were evaluated after 168 hours from both sex hormone stimulation and staurosporine treatment (17 nM for 24 hours) by annexin V-propidium iodide analysis (MBL Co., Ltd, Nagoya, Japan), in order to detect the early-stage apoptosis (cells only annexin-positive) and the late-stage apoptosis (cells annexin-positive and propidium-positive).
8851
8998
After resuspending the cells (1 × 105) into 200 μl of 1 x binding buffer, 1 μl fluorescein-labelled annexin V and 1 μl propidium iodide were added.
8999
9072
Then the cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature (dark light).
9073
9261
Finally, the cells were plated on glass slides and analysed by fluorescence microscopy (550 nm) for a total of 500 cells per sample, which allows detection even of a single apoptotic cell.
9262
9588
To confirm the reduced DNA content (oligonucleosomal-size fragments) the cells stimulated with hormones, without and with staurosporine, after fixation were stained with intercalating dyes (propidium iodide) and were analysed by flow analysis cytometry scatter (Becton-Dickinson-Immunocytometry Systems, Erembodegem, Belgium).
9591
9721
THP-1 cells were harvested at a concentration of 5 × 103, being sedimented on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides for 40 min at 4°C.
9722
10027
The spots were then air-dried and fixed in cold acetone for 30 s, and stored at -20°C until the immunodetermination of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)-cleaved expression, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, NF-κB, IκB-α and IκB-α-ser 32 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
10028
10147
After rehydration in PBS, spots were incubated with the anti-human antibody at different dilutions at room temperature.
10148
10304
The second and third steps were performed using the improved biotin-streptavidin-amplified detection system (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA).
10305
10789
Briefly, according to this method, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (biotinylated IgG, 1:20 dilution) for 20 min at room temperature and then, after several washes in PBS, cells were treated with the concentrated enzyme label (biotin-streptavidin-peroxidase) for 20 min and, finally, incubated at room temperature with the peroxidase-substrate solution (0.04% 3,3-diaminobenzidine [Sigma-Aldrich] in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxide) for 15 min.
10790
10972
After rinsing with PBS, slides were counterstained with haematoxylin, were dried and cover slipped with Eukitt, and were examined by light microscopy and computerized image analysis.
10973
11064
Controls were treated identically, except for omitting the primary or secondary antibodies.
11067
11164
Image analysis was performed with the Leica Q500 MC Image Analysis System (Leica, Cambridge, UK).
11165
11307
For each sample, 100 cells were randomly analysed and the pixels per micron square (positive area) were quantified by the Leica Q500 software.
11308
11435
The single cells were randomly selected by the operators using the cursor and then automatically measured as the positive area.
11436
11530
A constant optical threshold and filter combination was set to select only the positive cells.
11533
11686
The results were analysed by the analysis of variance non-parametric test (Bonferroni test), and the values are presented as means ± standard deviations.
11689
11862
Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour at 4°C.
11863
11917
The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm.
11918
11968
The surnatants were collected and stored at -80°C.
11971
12141
The samples of surnatants were thereafter diluted with reducing sample buffer and were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel (20 μg protein per lane loaded).
12142
12242
The proteins were transferred onto Hybond-C-nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Italia, Milan, Italy).
12243
12323
The reaction was blocked by DPBS with 5% non-fat powdered milk at 4°C overnight.
12324
12615
For immunoblot analysis, the membranes were incubated with the different antibodies for 1 hour (NF-κB, IκB-α, IκB-α-ser 32, respectively; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (dilution 1:200) in DPBS at room temperature with constant shaking, and were washed extensively in 0.05% DPBS/Tween 20, pH 7.4.
12616
12828
Finally, the membranes were incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-labelled polyclonal anti-goat IgG antibody (SC-2020; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (dilution 1:5000) in DPBS for 1 hour at room temperature.
12829
12950
After washing three times in DPBS, the bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Italia).
12953
13154
Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild-type and mutated NF-κB consensus element (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as 32P-labelled probes or as unlabelled competitors (100 times).
13155
13332
The assays were performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and 10% glycerol.
13333
13575
Briefly, 7 μg cell nuclear extracts, unstimulated or stimulated with testosterone and E2 as previously described, were pre-incubated with 4 μg poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia, Milan, Italy) as a non-specific competitor, for 10 min at room temperature.
13576
13737
End-labelled oligonucleotides (10 fmol, about 30,000 cpm) were then added to each mixture to a final volume of 20 μl and were incubated for an additional 20 min.
13738
13904
The bound/retarded complexes were separated from the free probe by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels and were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gels.
13905
13978
A lane without nuclear extract was also included as the negative control.
13979
14152
Competition experiments were performed in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabelled wall-type or mutated NF-κB oligonucleotide, added to the pre-incubation step.
14155
14342
For the super shift assay, 2 μl anti-p65, c-rel and p50 NF-κB subunit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were included in the pre-incubation mixture prior to the addition of the probe.
14343
14413
A lane containing pre-immune serum was always included as the control.
14416
14423
Results
14425
14554
As already stated, hormonal signals regulate the amount of the cell-cycle control proteins and of the transcription factors [26].
14555
14770
In the present study, after 168 hours we observed a significant growth inhibition of the human monocytic cell line activated with IFN-γ and treated with testosterone, when compared with the other conditions studied.
14771
14884
At 168 hours the cell growth was reduced by 14.8% versus untreated controls and by 12.7% versus E2-treated cells.
14885
15008
These data were obtained with the methyl-tetrazolium salt test and confirmed with the trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig. 1).
15009
15107
The bromodeoxyuridine/propidium iodide incorporation test showed similar results (data not shown).
15110
15226
Further interesting data were related to the modulation of the PCNA expression, as a marker for proliferating cells.
15227
15328
This marker was analysed by immunocytochemistry and the data were confirmed by western blot analysis.
15329
15563
In the testosterone-treated cells, the expression of the PCNA at the immunocytochemistry analysis was found decreased by 24% when compared with untreated cells, and was decreased by 40% when compared with E2-treated cells (Fig. 2a–d).
15564
15775
Interestingly, the testosterone-treated cells showed staining positivity localized in the cell cytoplasm, whereas in the untreated and E2-treated cells the PCNA expression was found predominantly in the nucleus.
15778
15957
In the present study the inhibitory role of E2 on apoptosis, as well as the pro-apoptotic effects exerted by testosterone in long-term treatment of THP-1 cells, were investigated.
15960
16124
The annexin V-propidium iodide analysis showed a significant increase of early and late apoptosis in testosterone-treated cells when compared with other conditions.
16125
16312
In the absence of staurosporine, the apoptosis was found increased in testosterone-treated cells (9.9%) when compared with control untreated cells (2.7%) and with E2-treated cells (3.8%).
16313
16400
In the presence of staurosporine, the apoptotic cells were increased in all conditions.
16401
16516
In testosterone-treated cells (24.8%) the apoptosis was found increased when compared with untreated cells (19.4%).
16517
16626
On the contrary, in the E2-treated (15%) cells the apoptosis was decreased versus controls (19.4%) (Fig. 3a).
16627
16709
These data were confirmed by flow analysis cytometry scatter analysis (Fig. 3b,c).
16712
16909
The immunocytochemistry analysis showed a significant increase of the PARP-cleaved form in testosterone-treated cells compared with other conditions, suggesting an increase of pro-apoptotic events.
16910
17116
On the contrary, the PARP-cleaved staining showed a decrease (19% versus untreated controls) in E2-treated cells, suggesting a trend of oestrogens in protecting cells from the apoptotic stimuli (Fig. 4a–e).
17117
17170
These data were confirmed with western blot analysis.
17173
17385
The defined mechanism of NF-κB activation includes the site-specific phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the inhibitory IκB-α factor, which usually retains the NF-κB factors inactivated in cytosol [27].
17386
17590
We therefore performed western blot analysis to detect the expression of NF-κB (p65), IκB-α and the IκB-α phosphorylated form (IκB-α-ser 32) in THP-1 cells treated with the different hormone combinations.
17591
17996
As shown in western blot analysis (Fig. 5) a decreased expression of NF-κB (p65) and an increased content of IκB-α with a concomitant decrease of the IκB-α phosphorylated form was observed in testosterone-treated cells when compared with untreated controls and with E2-treated THP-1 cells; the differences between conditions observed with staurosporine treatment were similar but the expression was lower.
17997
18211
The observed differences between E2-treated and testosterone-treated THP-1 cells were confirmed by immunocytochemistry staining and image analysis; similar data were observed with staurosporine treatment (Table 1).
18212
18457
The concomitant electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis for the evaluation of the NF-κB DNA binding confirmed an increased binding in E2-treated cells, when compared with other conditions with or without staurosporine, as shown in Fig. 6a.
18458
18639
Finally, the gel shift assay of nuclear protein extracts from E2-treated cells again showed an increase of the p65 subunit DNA binding (Fig. 6b) when compared with other conditions.
18640
18701
Similar results were obtained during staurosporine treatment.
18704
18714
Discussion
18716
18928
Monocytes/macrophages contribute to the autoimmune process, mainly acting as antigen-processing/presenting cells and sources of inflammatory cytokines, particularly at the level of the synovial tissue in RA [28].
18929
19067
Moreover, sex hormones can exert local actions (paracrine) in the tissues in which they are formed, including the synovial tissue [29,30].
19070
19146
Activated THP-1 cells differentiate into macrophages for long-term cultures.
19147
19243
On the contrary, synovial macrophages are characterized by a short life during in vitro culture.
19246
19444
The present study shows opposite effects by sex hormones on cultures of activated monocytic/macrophage cells (THP-1 cells) concerning their modulatory effects on cell proliferation and/or apoptosis.
19447
19729
The signalling pathways modulating the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms seem to involve steroidal hormone receptor activation and the NF-κB complex factors, In addition, oestrogens may differently regulate NF-κB activation depending on the cell type tested [14,31].
19732
19924
E2 therefore increased the expression of markers of cell growth and proliferation, whereas testosterone induced an increase of the PARP-cleaved expression, indicating DNA damage and apoptosis.
19925
20148
In addition, to support the proliferative role exerted by E2, the THP-1 cells pre-treated with the oestrogens showed a decrease of staurosporine-induced apoptosis when compared with testosterone-treated and untreated cells.
20149
20524
Furthermore, the increased NF-κB p65 expression and the evident NF-κB binding to DNA in E2-treated cells, when compared with untreated cells or with testosterone-treated cells, as well as the increased levels of the IκB-α phosphorylated form, seems to support the major enhancing role exerted by oestrogens on the immune/inflammatory response by activating the NF-κB complex.
20527
20805
On the contrary, the observed positive upregulation of IκB-α exerted by testosterone treatment presumably dampens the pro-inflammatory effects mediated by the NF-κB activation, and therefore might represent a further mechanism by which androgens exert anti-inflammatory effects.
20806
20995
Recent studies support these results, showing that E2 inhibits apoptosis in different cell types (cardiac myocytes and others) whereas androgens have been found to induce apoptosis [32,33].
20998
21340
The increased concentrations of oestrogens (and low androgens) recently described at the level of the synovial fluid of RA patients of both sexes [29] seem to support their possible modulator roles on synovial tissue hyperplasia and chronic synovial cell activation, by considering the oestrogenic effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis.
21341
21427
These observations have been recently obtained also in human breast cancer cells [34].
21430
21709
To explain increased oestrogen concentrations in RA synovial fluids, the pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor alpha, IL-1β, IL-6) have been found to accelerate the metabolic conversion of oestrogens from androgens by inducing the synovial tissue aromatases [35-37].
21710
21869
As a consequence, locally increased oestrogen levels might exert activating effects on synovial cell proliferation, including macrophages and fibroblasts [38].
21872
21882
Conclusion
21884
22122
In the present study the concentrations for E2 and testosterone tested seem to modulate the activity of NF-κB molecules in the human monocytic/macrophage cell line (THP-1) with opposite effects, interfering with cell growth and apoptosis.
22123
22275
These observations might provide a further biological link between gender effects and the complex inflammatory process involved in rheumatoid synovitis.
22276
22424
Further studies, using peripheral metabolites of oestrogens and synovial macrophages from RA patients, might extend the value of these observations.
