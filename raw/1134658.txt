106
114
Abstract
116
273
Background: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the TGF-β superfamily and are secreted proteins with pleiotropic roles in many different cell types.
274
394
A potential role of BMP-6 in the immune system has been implied by various studies of malignant and rheumatoid diseases.
395
488
In the present study, we explored the role of BMP-6 in normal human peripheral blood B cells.
489
620
Results: The B cells were found to express BMP type I and type II receptors and BMP-6 rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8.
621
761
Furthermore, Smad-phosphorylation was followed by upregulation of Id1 mRNA and Id1 protein, whereas Id2 and Id3 expression was not affected.
762
962
Furthermore, we found that BMP-6 had an antiproliferative effect both in naïve (CD19+CD27-) and memory B cells (CD19+CD27+) stimulated with anti-IgM alone or the combined action of anti-IgM and CD40L.
963
1030
Additionally, BMP-6 induced cell death in activated memory B cells.
1031
1154
Importantly, the antiproliferative effect of BMP-6 in B-cells was completely neutralized by the natural antagonist, noggin.
1155
1250
Furthermore, B cells were demonstrated to upregulate BMP-6 mRNA upon stimulation with anti-IgM.
1251
1401
Conclusion: In mature human B cells, BMP-6 inhibited cell growth, and rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 followed by an upregulation of Id1.

Background
1415
1582
Members of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily play central roles in controlling cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis [1].
1583
1760
These cytokines can be divided into three subgroups: TGF-β, the activins/inhibins, and the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), of which the latter constitute the largest family.
1761
1904
BMPs are 30–38 kDa hetero- or homodimeric proteins originally identified by their ability to induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation [2,3].
1905
2042
Several studies have demonstrated an essential role of these proteins during embryogenesis, and more recently, also in adult tissues [1].
2043
2198
TGF-β has been intensively studied in normal and malignant haematopoietic cells and is one of the most potent endogenous negative regulators known to date.
2199
2203
[4].
2204
2290
In contrast, the effect of BMPs in the immune system has not been widely investigated.
2291
2436
In that respect, BMP- 2, -4 and -7 have been found to control differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells [5] and early T cell development [6,7].
2437
2557
BMP-6 has been reported to reduce the number of cobblestone-area-forming cells of normal human haematopoietic cells [8].
2558
2675
Furthermore, BMP-2, -4, 6 and -7 had an antiproliferative and a proapoptotic effect on multiple myeloma cells [9-11].
2676
2888
In addition, by gene expression profiling, BMP-6 significantly increased the predictive value for a multi-gene signature test and was associated with a poor outcome in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) [12].
2891
3147
BMP-6, like the other BMP members, signals through ligation and heterodimerzation of BMP type I [activin-like-kinase (ALK)] and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors, which subsequently propagates the signal downstream by phosphorylating Smad proteins.
3148
3383
BMP-6 can signal through the ligation of the type I receptors Act-RIA, BMP-RIA, and BMP-RIB and the type II receptors BMP-RII, Act-RIIA and Act-RIIB, which lead to the phosphorylation of the receptor Smads (Smad-1, Smad-5, and Smad-8).
3384
3520
The R- Smads then form complexes with the co-Smad (Smad4) and are translocated into the nucleus where they exert gene regulation [1,13].
3523
3680
Given the reported role of BMP-6 in B-cell malignancies and haematopoietic progenitor cells, we wanted to explore its potential role in normal human B cells.
3681
3778
We studied the effects of BMP-6 on proliferation and apoptosis on resting and stimulated B cells.
3779
3954
Furthermore, the expression of BMP receptors and BMP-6 induced activation of the Smad signalling pathway with subsequent regulation of the target genes Id1–Id4, were resolved.
3955
4033
Finally, we investigated whether B cells also were capable of producing BMP-6.
4036
4043
Results
4045
4183
The effects of BMP-6 on normal and neoplastic hematopoietic cells prompted us to investigate the effects of BMP-6 on normal human B cells.
4184
4335
All experiments in this study were performed under serum-free conditions as FCS has been shown to interfere with BMP-signalling [14](own observations).
4336
4509
To study the effect of BMP-6 on proliferation, B-cells from healthy volunteers were stimulated with anti-IgM and/or CD40L in the presence or absence of BMP-6 for three days.
4510
4624
We found that BMP-6 led to a 35% mean reduction of anti-IgM- induced DNA synthesis (n = 8; p ≤ 0.0002, Figure 1A).
4625
4738
Similar results were obtained for B cells treated with anti-IgM and CD40L (26% mean reduction, n = 6; p ≤ 0.023).
4739
4928
The BMP-6-induced inhibition of proliferation was dose-dependent in both peripheral B cells (Figure 1B) and the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos (40% reduction of DNA synthesis, Figure 1C).
4929
5027
The BMP-6 effects could be reversed by addition of the extracellular inhibitor Noggin (Figure 1D).
5028
5163
Similarly, a combination of the soluble BMP receptors BMP-RIB-Fc and BMP-RII-Fc also neutralized the effects of BMP-6 (data not shown).
5164
5251
Next, we wanted to test whether BMP-6 had different effect on naïve and memory B cells.
5252
5468
Naïve (CD19+CD27-) and memory (CD19+CD27+) B cells were isolated from peripheral blood by cell sorting of immunobead-isolated CD19+ B cells [15], and tested for their capacity to proliferate in the presence of BMP-6.
5469
5713
However, BMP-6 inhibited anti-IgM induced DNA synthesis in the two subpopulations to a similar extent, with a mean reduction of DNA-synthesis of 45% (n = 5; p ≤ 0,004) for naïve B cells and 48% (n = 5; p ≤ 0,001) for memory B cells (Figure 1E).
5716
5809
Next, we wanted to establish whether BMP-6 also could affect the viability of normal B cells.
5810
5923
Cell viability was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining after culture with or without BMP-6 for 48 hours.
5924
6084
Interestingly, BMP-6 showed a small, but reproducible mean increase of cell death from 17 to 23% (n = 5; p ≤ 0,003) in anti-IgM stimulated CD27+ memory B cells.
6085
6213
Furthermore, Ramos cells showed a mean increase in cell death from 20 to 50% (n = 3, p < 0,001, figure 3) after BMP-6 treatment.
6214
6379
In contrast, cell death of total CD19+ cells (n = 6; p ≤ 0,32; data not shown) or CD27-IgG- naïve B cells was not significantly affected (n = 5; p ≤ 0,65, figure 2).
6382
6487
Detailed knowledge regarding expression of different BMP receptors in B cells is currently not available.
6488
6616
To further elucidate the role of BMPs in human B cells, we performed western blot analysis for type I and type II BMP receptors.
6617
6780
This analysis revealed that the type I receptors Act-RIA, BMP-RIB and the type II receptors BMP-RII and Act-RIIb are expressed on resting human B-cells (Figure 4).
6781
6929
Ramos cells expressed the type I receptors Act-RIA, weakly BMP-RIB and the type II receptor BMP-RII, but more weakly than normal B cells (Figure 4).
6930
7007
HL60 cells were used for comparison and weakly expressed Act-RIA and BMP-RII.
7010
7152
Taken together, these data show that normal human B cells and Ramos cells express a set of BMP receptors, previously shown to bind BMP-6 [16].
7155
7251
Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor transphosphorylates and activates the type I receptor.
7252
7301
Type I receptors can signal via several pathways.
7302
7446
We examined the effect of BMP-6 on Smad phosphorylation, as the activation of Smad is considered to be a major signalling pathway for BMPs [17].
7447
7552
B cells were cultured in serum-free media over night and then treated with BMP-6 for various time points.
7553
7688
Total protein lysates were prepared, and the amounts of the phosphorylated forms of Smad1/5/8 were determined by western blot analysis.
7689
7767
Interestingly, treatment with 500 ng/ml BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad.
7768
7910
The BMP-6 induced phosphorylation was high at the earliest time point tested (15 minutes), and remained high for at least 48 hours (Figure 5).
7911
7999
A similar phosphorylation was observed in Ramos cells, but not in HL60 cells (Figure 6).
8000
8133
Furthermore, we also tested whether other known downstream signalling pathways of BMP-6 could be triggered by BMP-6 in human B cells.
8134
8280
However, we did not observe any significant changes in the level of phospho-STAT3 or phospho-p38 upon BMP-6 treatment of B cells (data not shown).
8283
8424
Next, we wanted to explore whether the BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 also could induce transcriptional changes of target genes.
8425
8563
In this regard, the inhibitors of DNA binding proteins (Ids) are considered to be some of the major target genes for Smad-signalling [17].
8564
8740
Thus, B cells were pre-incubated over night in X-VIVO 15, and then cultured in medium alone or in the presence of BMP-6 for various time points before preparation of total RNA.
8741
8803
The amount of Id1–Id4 mRNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR.
8804
8913
Interestingly, we observed a specific four-fold upregulation of Id1 mRNA in BMP-6-treated B cells (Figure 7).
8914
9095
The up-regulation of Id1 mRNA was characteristic of an early inducible gene, with maximal upregulation two hours after the addition of BMP-6 and returned to baseline after 24 hours.
9096
9239
In contrast, no significant changes were observed for Id2 and Id3 mRNA, whereas Id4-transcripts were not detectable (Figure 7, data not shown).
9242
9382
Western blot analysis revealed that the BMP-6-induced upregulation of Id1 mRNA also was correlated with upregulation of Id1 protein as well.
9383
9582
The increase in Id1 protein level was detectable after one hour and increased until 24 hours after BMP-6 addition, showing a 16-fold upregulation compared with t0 (p ≤ 0.020, n = 4) (Figure 8 and 9).
9583
9705
In line with the mRNA data, no consistent change in the amounts of Id2 and Id3 protein could be observed (Figure 8 and 9).
9706
9791
We were able to block the Id1 specific band with a blocking peptide (data not shown).
9792
9965
Taken together, these data suggest that Id1 could be a possible target gene for mediating the effects of BMP-6 in human B cells, whereas Id2 and Id3 not seem to be involved.
9968
10172
The fact that BMP-6 has been reported to act as an autocrine stimulator in chondrocytes [18] and ovarium [19], prompted us to investigate whether normal human B cells could produce BMP-6 upon stimulation.
10173
10336
Ramos cells, which have been described to express BMP-6 mRNA endogenously [20], and the T cell line Jurkat, served as positive and negative controls, respectively.
10337
10478
Endogenous BMP-6 mRNA levels in normal B cells were quantified by real-time RT-PCR after stimulation with anti-IgM for different time points.
10479
10656
Interestingly, the up-regulation of BMP-6 mRNA was characteristic of an early-to intermediate inducible gene with maximal upregulation four hours after the addition of anti-IgM.
10657
10746
The level of BMP-6 mRNA was back to baseline after 24 hours upon stimulation (Figure 10).
10747
10847
Furthermore, both FCS and human AB-serum induced significant upregulation of BMP-6 mRNA (Figure 11).
10848
11011
Interestingly, in a separate study we have found that normal human T cells do not express BMP-6 mRNA after activation (Sivertsen et al, manuscript in preparation).
11012
11123
Next, we wanted to detect BMP-6 protein in normal B-cells and tested various commercially available antibodies.
11124
11250
However, in our hands these anti-BMP-6 antibodies did only recognize the recombinant BMP-6 protein and not the native protein.
11253
11263
Discussion
11265
11508
Recent studies have demonstrated an important role for BMP superfamily members in hematopoietic stem cells, early thymocytes [6,7] and B-cell malignancies [8,11,12], but a role for BMPs in normal human B cells has previously not been reported.
11509
11622
The present study demonstrated a significant antiproliferative effect of BMP-6 in peripheral blood CD19+ B cells.
11623
11737
Additionally, BMP-6 induced cell death in CD27+ memory B cells as well as in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line (Ramos).
11738
11823
Importantly, BMP-6 induced a rapid and marked increase in Smad-1/5/8 phosphorylation.
11824
11956
Furthermore, the BMP-6 induced Smad phosphorylation was followed by a selective upregulation of Id1 mRNA and subsequent Id1 protein.
11959
12095
In the present study, the demonstrated antiproliferative effect of BMP-6 in anti-IgM treated B cells was significant and dose-dependent.
12096
12222
Importantly, the anti-proliferative effect of BMP-6 could be completely neutralized by the use of a natural inhibitor, Noggin.
12223
12315
This is in line with others, showing that Noggin can function as a BMP-6 antagonist [21,22].
12316
12471
In addition, the combination of soluble BMP-RIB-Fc and BMP-RII-Fc fusion proteins also neutralized the anti-proliferative effect of BMP-6 in human B cells.
12472
12578
Interestingly, as for other TGF family members, bifunctional effects have also been demonstrated for BMPs.
12579
12832
Whereas several of the BMPs have been shown to promote proliferation in various cell types including condrocytes [23], liver [24] and granulosa cells [25], antiproliferative effects and induction of apoptosis has been reported for B and T lineage cells.
12833
12985
Similar effects as demonstrated for BMP-6 on human B cells in the present study, were demonstrated for BMP-2, 4, 6 and -7 in human myeloma cells [9-11].
12986
13103
Other members of the BMP-family have also been reported to induce apoptosis, including in mouse B lineage cells [26].
13104
13161
Additionally, BMP-4 inhibits thymocyte proliferation [6].
13162
13298
Taken together, these data suggest that the role of BMPs in the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis is highly cell type dependent.
13301
13425
To examine how BMP-6 exerts its functional effects in B cells, we analysed BMP receptor expression by western blot analysis.
13426
13635
Human peripheral B cells were found to express the BMP type I receptors Act-RIA and BMP-RIB, and the type II-receptors BMP-RII and Act-RIIb, which signal after binding of several BMPs, including BMP-6 [16,13].
13636
13724
To further explore BMP-6 induced signalling, activation of several pathways is possible.
13725
13802
The major signalling pathway known to date, is activation of R-Smads [13,27].
13803
13933
In that respect, BMPs have been shown to exert antiproliferative effects in B lineage cells via phosphorylation of R-Smad [11,28].
13934
14019
Furthermore, BMP-2 has been shown to induce activation of STAT3 in myeloma cells [9].
14020
14090
However, phosphorylation of R-Smad was not investigated in that study.
14091
14155
BMP-2 has also been shown to induce phosphorylation of p38 [29].
14156
14353
Thus, phosphorylation of p38, STAT3 and Smad1/5/8 represent important BMP-signalling pathways that mediated the effects of BMPs and even cross-talk between these pathways has been reported [29,30].
14354
14499
In the present study, we were not able to detect BMP-6-induced changes in the phosphorylation status of STAT3 or p38 in human peripheral B cells.
14500
14570
Instead, a rapid and marked phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 was revealed.
14571
14703
In a parallel study, we have found that other BMPs also induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 in peripheral B cells (data not shown).
14704
14870
We are currently pursuing microarray studies to identify the signalling pathways and target genes that are differently regulated by the various BMPs in human B cells.
14873
15090
Upregulation of Id1 via Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation is a known mechanism for BMP-6 signalling in other cell systems [31,32] and regulation of Id-proteins is thought to be an important mechanism for Smad-signalling [17].
15091
15266
In the present study, real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed a specific four-fold upregulation for Id1 in BMP-6-treated B cells, while the amount of Id2–Id4 remained unchanged.
15267
15424
In agreement with this, western blot analysis demonstrated an upregulation of Id1 protein, while the amount of Id2 and Id3 protein levels remained unchanged.
15425
15627
Previously, Id1 has been considered not to be expressed in later developmental stages than pro-B cells [33,34], and its constitutive expression has been reported to impair mouse B cell development [35].
15628
15773
Therefore, our demonstration of the time-dependent upregulation of Id1 mRNA and protein in mature normal human B cells is of particular interest.
15774
15932
In that respect, it is noteworthy that TGF-β signalling in early and mature B cells induces both Id2 and Id3 expression [36,37], but not Id1 (data not shown).
15933
16041
Interestingly, these results show that various members of the TGF-β family regulate Id proteins differently.
16042
16131
Id2 and Id3 are considered to be the Id proteins mainly expressed in mature B cells [38].
16132
16248
The present study also found Id2 and Id3 protein in B cells to be more highly expressed than Id1 in resting B cells.
16249
16340
However, BMP-6 did not induce significant changes in the protein expression of Id2 and Id3.
16341
16451
It is believed that Id proteins block differentiation and promote proliferation in various cell types [39,33].
16452
16602
Id proteins act as dominant-negative inhibitors of E-proteins and Pax5 function by forming dimers with these proteins, making them unable to bind DNA.
16603
16735
It has been proposed that the balance among E-proteins, Pax5 and Id proteins might have an important role in activated B cells [38].
16736
16901
In that respect, E-proteins have been implicated in both the promotion and inhibition of cell survival and growth at different points in lymphocyte development [40].
16902
17171
The antiproliferative and death inducing effect of BMP-6 in B cells with concomitant upregulation of Id1 protein is therefore in line with the view that Id proteins are required for the induction of growth arrest and apoptosis in B-lymphocyte progenitors by TGF-β [40].
17174
17310
Furthermore, Id proteins are known as important parts of signalling pathways involved in development, cell cycle and tumorigenesis [32].
17311
17571
It is well established that various members of the Id family are overexpressed in a range of human tumours and generally, Id1 appears to be the family member most widely overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies [41], including multiple myeloma [42,32].
17572
17754
Additionally, our findings that BMP-6 activates intracellular signalling pathways in human B cells might be of potential pathophysiological significance in lymphoma and inflammation.
17755
17848
High BMP-6 mRNA expression in DLBCL has been shown to correlate to unfavourable outcome [12].
17849
18045
In this respect, it is of interest that targeted expression of Id1 to B-lymphocytes resulted in aberrant B cell development, massive apoptosis, and subsequent development of B cell lymphomas [35].
18046
18219
Moreover, BMP-6 has been suggested to play a role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [43,44] and elevated levels of Id1 and Id3 have been found in the synovia of RA-patients [45].
18220
18380
Altogether, these results point to an important role for Id proteins in the regulation of normal B cell homeostasis and in diseases, where B cells are involved.
18381
18534
It will therefore be important to further elucidate the role of Id-1 in human B cells by selective over expression or inhibition of Id-1 gene expression.
18537
18777
Given the role of BMP-6 in mature human B cells demonstrated here, identification of BMP-6 producing cells in vivo with possibility of interaction with naïve and memory B cells might contribute to the understanding of mature B cell biology.
18778
18866
High BMP-6 mRNA expression in DLBCL has been detected by gene expression profiling [12].
18867
18971
Furthermore, production of BMP-6 transcripts in normal activated B cells was detected in the same study.
18972
19079
Of note, an autocrine BMP-6 loop has been reported by others in chondrocytes and in the ovarium [46,19,18].
19080
19173
Therefore, we wanted to explore the possibility for an autocrine BMP-6 loop in human B cells.
19174
19398
We analysed the expression BMP-6 mRNA in peripheral blood B cells by real-time PCR, and report here the upregulation of endogenous BMP-6 transcripts after stimulation with FCS, human AB-serum and, most importantly, anti-IgM.
19399
19621
However, our attempts to study BMP-6 protein levels were unsuccessful due to problems with unspecific binding of the anti-BMP-6 antibodies tested, and lack of specific staining in control cells known to express BMP-6 mRNA.
19622
19680
In contrast, the recombinant protein was readily detected.
19681
19791
In that respect, few investigators have detected BMP-6 protein in humans, especially in non-pathogenic tissue.
19792
20001
The possibility of BMP-6 production in human B-cells is in line with a recent work that reported the production of BMP-6 in mouse B cells, infiltrating the bone marrow of mice with inflammatory arthritis [43].
20002
20089
In this study, a role for BMPs in the inflammatoric process of arthritis was suggested.
20090
20192
The upregulation of the BMP-6-transcripts after IgM-crosslinking is of pathophysiologic interest [12].
20193
20372
A loss of TGF-β-responsiveness has been suggested to be a critical contribution to malignant transformation [47,48] and similar oncogenic mechanisms have been postulated for BMPs.
20373
20529
Lines of evidence suggest [49] that at early stages of carcinogenesis, BMP-6 is not a tumour promoter, but suppresses benign and malignant tumour outgrowth.
20530
20753
These findings are in good agreement with previous findings for other TGF-β family members, including TGF-β1 and BMP-4 [50], indicating that cellular context of the BMP target cell might define the various observed effects.
20754
21054
In contrast to the upregulation of BMP-6 transcript in B cells, we were not able to detect BMP-6 transcripts in human peripheral blood CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (resting or stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28; data not shown), consistent with the findings in T cell lines [20] and T cells in mice [43].
21055
21205
Other potential BMP-6 sources for mature B cells in vivo might be other cells of the immune system or tissue with contact to the hematopoietic system.
21206
21302
One well recognized source for BMP-6 production is the human bone and bone marrow stroma [51,8].
21303
21482
Furthermore, it is noteworthy that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) highly express BMP-6 mRNA [52], and vascular endothelium has been reported to produce BMP-6 [53].
21483
21567
These studies might imply a role for BMP-6 in transendothelial migration of B cells.
21568
21657
BMP-6 mRNA has been demonstrated in murine macrophage cell lines, but not in humans [54].
21658
21816
In accordance with these findings, other human cell lines of neutrophil and monocytic origin have been described to be negative for the BMP-6 transcript [20].
21817
21912
To our knowledge, there is currently no report about BMP-6 production of human dendritic cells.
21915
21925
Conclusion
21927
22089
In conclusion, our results show that BMP-6 induces activation of intracellular Smad signalling in mature human B-cells with consecutive production of Id1 protein.
22090
22243
Furthermore, we report that BMP-6 has an antiproliferative effect in B cells stimulated with anti-IgM alone or the combined action of anti-IgM and CD40L.
22244
22327
Additionally, BMP-6 induces cell death in activated memory B cells and Ramos cells.
22328
22537
Taken together, these results provide a rationale to further examine the role of BMP-6 signalling in normal B cell biology as well as in pathologic conditions like B cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders.
