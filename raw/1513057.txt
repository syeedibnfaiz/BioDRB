Abstract
152
212
The accumulation of neutrophils at sites of tissue injury or
213
277
infection is mediated by chemotactic factors released as part of
278
303
the inflammatory process.
304
342
Some of these factors are generated as
343
404
a direct consequence of tissue injury or infection, including
405
460
degradation fragments of connective tissue collagen and
461
525
bacterial- or viral-derived peptides containing collagen-related
526
544
structural motifs.
545
586
In these studies, we examined biochemical
587
642
mechanisms mediating the biologic activity of synthetic
643
702
polypeptides consisting of repeated units of proline (Pro),
703
767
glycine (Gly), and hydroxyproline (Hyp), major amino acids found
768
809
within mammalian and bacterial collagens.
810
827
We found that the
828
875
peptides were chemoattractants for neutrophils.
876
891
Moreover, their
892
950
chemotactic potency was directly related to their size and
951
963
composition.
964
1012
Thus, the pentameric peptides (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 and
1013
1072
(Pro-Hyp-Gly)5 were more active in inducing chemotaxis than
1073
1129
the corresponding decameric peptides (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and
1130
1146
(Pro-Hyp-Gly)10.
1147
1182
In addition, the presence of Hyp in
1183
1221
peptides reduced chemotactic activity.
1222
1244
The synthetic peptides
1245
1292
were also found to reduce neutrophil apoptosis.
1293
1307
In contrast to
1308
1368
chemotaxis, this activity was independent of peptide size or
1369
1381
composition.
1382
1432
The effects of the peptides on both chemotaxis and
1433
1493
apoptosis were blocked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol
1494
1558
3-kinase (PI3-K) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase.
1559
1615
However, only (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 induced
1616
1674
expression of PI3-K and phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase,
1675
1738
suggesting a potential mechanism underlying reduced chemotactic
1739
1775
activity of Hyp-containing peptides.
1776
1796
Although none of the
1797
1862
synthetic peptides tested had any effect on intracellular calcium
1863
1921
mobilization, each induced nuclear binding activity of the
1922
1949
transcription factor NF-κB.
1950
1978
These findings indicate that
1979
2037
polymeric polypeptides containing Gly-X-Y collagen-related
2038
2103
structural motifs promote inflammation by inducing chemotaxis and
2104
2123
blocking apoptosis.
2124
2161
However, distinct calcium-independent
2162
2223
signaling pathways appear to be involved in these activities.
2225
2235
BACKGROUND
2237
2354
The inflammatory response is characterized by an accumulation of neutrophils at sites of tissue injury and infection.
2355
2589
Neutrophils respond to chemotactic factors including connective tissue degradation products, leukotriene B4, and bacterially-derived formylmethionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP), released from damaged tissue or by invading pathogens.
2590
2865
In previous studies we demonstrated that collagenase or cyanogen bromide digests of native collagen, as well as synthetic collagen-like polypeptides containing glycine (Gly), proline (Pro), and hydroxyproline (Hyp) are potent chemoattractants for human neutrophils [1, 2, 3].
2866
2949
These polypeptides also activated macrophages to release neutrophil chemokines [4].
2950
3112
The present studies were aimed at analyzing mechanisms mediating the biological activity of collagen degradation products using synthetic polypeptides as a model.
3113
3288
Synthetic polypeptides are similar to degradation products generated from mammalian collagen and/or to collagen-related structural motifs produced by bacteria and viruses [5].
3289
3408
The use of synthetic model peptides of varying length and composition allowed us to perform structure-activity studies.
3411
3547
Chemoattractants such as fMLP and interleukin-8 (IL-8) initiate their biological activity by binding to specific cell surface receptors.
3548
3819
For most chemoattractants, this is followed by mobilization of intracellular calcium, activation of protein kinases, and translocation and binding of transcription factors to consensus sequences in promoter regions of genes regulating the inflammatory response [6, 7, 8].
3820
3970
We speculated that variations in the activity of the synthetic peptides may be related to their distinct ability to activate these signaling pathways.
3973
3980

5508
These studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of UMDNJ Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.
5511
5638
Migration of neutrophils through nucleopore polycarbonate filters was assayed using the modified Boyden chamber technique [10].
5639
5735
For our studies we used a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber (Neuro Probe, Inc, Pleasanton, Calif).
5736
5861
Thirty microliters of synthetic peptides, fMLP (5 × 10−8 M), or medium control were placed in each well of the lower chamber.
5862
5954
A 5-μm pore-size filter was then placed over the wells and the upper chamber set into place.
5955
6118
Fifty microliters of a neutrophil suspension (1 × 105cells) in HBSS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2.4 mg/ml HEPES, pH 7.2, was added to each well.
6119
6255
After incubation for 45 minutes at 37°C, the filter containing adhered, migrated neutrophils was removed and stained with Wright-Giemsa.
6256
6365
Chemotaxis was quantified as the number of cells that migrated through the filter in 10 oil immersion fields.
6366
6543
In some experiments, cells were incubated at room temperature with LY 294002 (50 μM, 5 minutes) or SB 203580 (30 μM, 1 hour) prior to the analysis of chemotactic responsiveness.
6546

6617
6731
Neutrophils were inoculated into Nunc coverglass chambers (2 × 106 cells/chamber) and allowed to adhere overnight.
6732
6825
Cells were then washed with HBSS containing 0.3% BSA and incubated in 1 μM Indo-1 AM at 37°C.
6826
6938
After 30 minutes, the cells were washed three times and 1 mL of HBSS containing 0.3% BSA was added to each well.
6939

7114
7235
For measurement of cellular fluorescence, Indo-1 was excited using the ultraviolet lines (351–364 nm) of the argon laser.
7236
7473
Calcium mobilization was quantified by scanning single 130 × 130 μm fields containing ≥ 15 cells every 8 seconds for a total of 5 minutes and collecting the emissions at 485 nm (calcium-free Indo-1) and 405 nm (calcium-saturated Indo-1).
7474

Data are presented as the ratio of emission at 405 nm relative to 485 nm.
7548
7672
Synthetic peptides (10 nM) or fMLP (5 × 10−8 M) were added to the cells 180 seconds after stable baselines were established.
7675
7878
Neutrophils were incubated (37°C) with medium control, fMLP (5 × 10−8 M), or 10 nM (Pro-Pro-Gly)5, (Pro-Pro-Gly)10, (Pro-Hyp-Gly)5, or (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 for 2 hours (PI3-K) or 5 minutes (p38, phospho-p38).
7879
8097
Cells were then solubilized in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 μg/mL pepstatin A, 1 μg/mL leupeptin, 10 μg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100.
8098
8311
After 10 minutes in ice, lysates were centrifuged (4000 xg, 5 minutes) and protein concentrations in the supernatants were quantified using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill) with BSA as the standard.
8312
8632
Aliquots of supernatants containing 10 μg of protein were fractionated on 7.5% SDS polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto 0.45 μm nitrocellulose paper (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif) at 250 mA for 4 hours in a Mini Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad) in 25 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mM Gly, 20% (v/v) methanol.
8633
8766
Blots were then incubated in a 1 : 250 dilution of anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase antibody, anti-p38 MAP kinase, or anti-PI3-K antibody.
8767
8934
After washing, the blots were incubated with goat antimouse IgG (1 : 2000) or sheep antirabbit IgG (1 : 1000) HRP-conjugated antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature.
8935
9060
Proteins were detected using a Renaissance Western Blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus kit (NEN Life Sciences, Boston, Mass).
9063
9293
Neutrophils were washed in PBS, resuspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and incubated in a shaking water bath at 37°C for 24 hours in the presence or absence of peptides (10 nM).
9294
9508
Cells were then centrifuged, resuspended (2 × 106 cells/mL) in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2), and incubated (15 minutes, room temperature) with Annexin V and propidium iodide.
9509
9594
Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry on a Coulter EPICS Profile II (Hialeah, Fla).
9595
9787
Viable, apoptotic, and necrotic neutrophil populations were gated electronically and data analyzed using quadrant statistics based on relative Annexin V and propidium iodide fluorescence [12].
9790
10006
To prepare nuclear extracts, neutrophils (2 × 106) were microcentrifuged for 15 seconds and then resuspended in 400 μL of cold buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF).
10007
10124
After 15 minutes in ice, 25 μL of a 10% solution of NP-40 was added, and the sample mixed on a vortex for 10 seconds.
10125
10381
The lysates were then centrifuged for 30 seconds in a microfuge, the nuclear pellets resuspended in 50 μL of ice-cold buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF) and placed on a rocker platform at 4°C for 15 minutes.
10382

11433
RESULTS
11435
11706
We have previously demonstrated that synthetic pentameric peptides consisting of Pro and Gly, or Pro, Hyp, and Gly are chemoattractants for neutrophils [1, 2, 3]. Figure 1 shows that the chemotactic activity of these peptides is dose related, reaching a maximum at 10 nM.
11707
11812
Increasing the length of the peptides from five to ten repeated units reduced their chemotactic activity.
11813
11955
At concentrations of 1 and 10 nM, peptides consisting of Pro, Gly, and Hyp were less chemotactic than peptides consisting of only Pro and Gly.
11956
12126
At optimal concentrations, (Pro-Pro-Gly)5, the most potent of the synthetic peptides, was approximately 60% less active than fMLP in inducing chemotaxis (data not shown).
12129
12248
Activated neutrophils are cleared from inflamed sites by the process of apoptosis, followed by macrophage phagocytosis.
12249
12315
This leads to resolution rather than persistence of tissue injury.
12316
12474
Chemoattractants such as fMLP promote inflammation by activating neutrophils and prolonging the survival of these cells in tissues by blocking apoptosis [13].
12475
12575
In further studies, we analyzed the effects of synthetic polymeric peptides on neutrophil apoptosis.
12576
12767
One of the earliest signs of apoptosis is translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner to the outer surface of the plasma membrane, which can be detected by Annexin V binding [14].
12768
12881
Approximately 30% of neutrophils was found to undergo spontaneous apoptosis after 24 hours in culture (Figure 2).
12882
12958
This activity was significantly reduced in the presence of the polypeptides.
12959
13018
The effects of the synthetic peptides were similar to fMLP.
13019
13166
In contrast to chemotaxis, no differences were noted in the antiapoptotic activity of collagen-like peptides in terms of their size or composition.
13169
13296
We next investigated potential biochemical signaling pathways mediating the biologic activity of these peptides in neutrophils.
13297
13375
For comparative purposes, we also evaluated the response of the cells to fMLP.
13376
13522
Treatment of neutrophils with fMLP caused a rapid and transient increase in intracellular calcium, which was evident within 30 seconds (Figure 3).
13523
13615
In contrast, none of the synthetic polypeptides induced calcium mobilization in neutrophils.
13616
13759
PI3-K catalyzes the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate and plays a key role in neutrophil activation and chemotaxis [15, 16].
13760
13844
Low levels of PI3-K protein were detectable in unstimulated neutrophils (Figure 4a).
13845
13959
Treatment of the cells with pentameric peptides consisting of Pro and Gly resulted in a twofold increase in PI3-K.
13960
14042
This was evident after 2 hours and was similar to the response observed with fMLP.
14043
14233
In contrast, the pentameric peptide containing Hyp had no effect on PI3-K, and increasing the length of the peptides from 5 to 10 repeated units did not alter the quantity of PI3-K detected.
14234
14356
To analyze the role of PI3-K in collagen peptide-induced chemotaxis and apoptosis, cells were treated with LY 294002 [17].
14357
14544
This PI3-K inhibitor was found to reduce chemotaxis induced by fMLP, (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10, as well as (Pro-Hyp-Gly)5, and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 by 50% (Figure 1b, data not shown).
14545
14635
No major differences were noted in the sensitivity of the peptides to the PI3-K inhibitor.
14636
14748
Similarly, LY 294002 was found to block the inhibitory effects of both fMLP and synthetic peptides on apoptosis.
14749
14918
As observed with chemotaxis, no differences were observed in the sensitivity of the antiapoptotic effects of the peptides to PI3-K inhibition (Figure 2, data not shown).
14919
15004
In the absence of these peptides, LY 294002 had no effect on chemotaxis or apoptosis.
15007
15139
Recent studies have implicated MAP kinases in chemoattractant-induced signaling and in PI3-K activation in neutrophils [18, 19, 20].
15140
15258
We found that untreated neutrophils expressed relatively large quantities of total p38 MAP kinase protein (Figure 4b).
15259
15337
Expression of this protein was unaltered by fMLP or by synthetic polypeptides.
15338
15547
In contrast, only low levels of phospho-p38 MAP kinase were detected in unstimulated neutrophils, and this was markedly increased in response to fMLP, as well as (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 (Figure 4c).
15548
15717
The effects of these peptides on phospho-p38 expression were rapid, peaking 5 minutes after treatment and persisting for at least 20 minutes (Figure 4d, data not shown).
15718
15844
Treatment of neutrophils with peptides containing Hyp had no significant effect on phospho-p38 protein expression (Figure 4c).
15845
16071
Pretreatment of the cells with SB 203580, a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor [21], was found to significantly reduce chemotaxis induced by (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10, as well as (Pro-Hyp-Gly)5, and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 (Figure 1b).
16072
16248
Similarly, SB 203580 blocked the effects of fMLP and synthetic peptides on apoptosis, indicating that this response is also p38 MAP kinase-dependent (Figure 2, data not shown).
16251
16352
The transcription factor NF-κB is known to be activated by chemoattractants through MAP kinases [22].
16353
16454
We found that each of the synthetic peptides, like fMLP, induced nuclear binding of NF-κB (Figure 5).
16455
16518
This response was independent of peptide length or composition.
16519
16608
Supershift assays revealed that the NF-κB complex contained both p50 and p65 (not shown).
16609
16753
Preincubation of nuclear extracts with excess unlabeled probe competitively reduced binding of the labeled probe, demonstrating its specificity.
16756
16766
DISCUSSION
16768
16892
Neutrophil chemotaxis and survival are regulated by inflammatory mediators that are present at sites of infection or injury.
16893
17049
Whereas proinflammatory mediators promote chemotaxis and block apoptosis, antiinflammatory cytokines are proapoptotic and abrogate the chemotactic response.
17050
17228
Coordinate regulation of chemotaxis and survival allows for the persistence of neutrophils at sites of injury, as well as effective termination of the inflammatory response [23].
17229
17382
The present studies demonstrate that synthetic peptides containing collagen-like structural motifs induce chemotaxis and reduce apoptosis in neutrophils.
17383
17458
These results are consistent with a proinflammatory role of these peptides.
17459
17618
This is supported by reports that synthetic collagen-like peptides also stimulate oxidative metabolism and macrophage release of neutrophil chemokines [4, 24].
17619
17696
Tissue injury is associated with breakdown of interstitial connective tissue.
17697
17902
Our findings that peptides containing collagen-like structural motifs exhibit proinflammatory activity suggests that they may play a role in amplifying acute immunological responses to infection or injury.
17905
18066
Consistent with previous studies [2, 3], we found that the chemotactic activity of the synthetic polypeptides was directly related to their size and composition.
18067
18175
Thus, larger peptides containing ten repeated subunits were less active than those containing five subunits.
18176
18294
Moreover, peptides consisting of Pro, Gly, and Hyp were less chemotactic than peptides consisting of only Pro and Gly.
18295
18437
In contrast, although each of the peptides markedly reduced neutrophil apoptosis, these effects were independent of peptide size or structure.
18438
18567
These data suggest that collagen peptide-induced chemotaxis and apoptosis involve distinct receptors and/or signaling mechanisms.
18570
18685
One early step in the signaling pathway induced by chemoattractants is mobilization of intracellular Ca++ [25, 26].
18686
18789
In contrast to fMLP, the synthetic peptides had no effect on calcium mobilization in human neutrophils.
18790
18926
These findings suggest that the chemotactic and antiapoptotic actions of these peptides do not require changes in intracellular calcium.
18927
19235
This is consistent with reports of other proinflammatory mediators that alter neutrophil chemotaxis and apoptosis by mechanisms independent of intracellular calcium shifts, including transforming growth factor-β1, soluble Fas ligand, immune complexes, and the antineutrophil antibody, DL1.2 [27, 28, 29, 30].
19236
19385
Our findings suggest that the requirement for increases in intracellular calcium for induction of biological activity depends on the chemoattractant.
19388
19588
Activation of protein kinases including PI3-K and p38 MAP kinase is thought to play a critical role in chemoattractant-induced signaling leading to biologic responses [19, 20, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36].
19589
19753
Consistent with this idea, we found that the effects of the synthetic peptides on chemotaxis and apoptosis were dependent on both PI3-K and p38 MAP kinase activity.
19754
19919
Thus, LY 294002 and SB 203580, inhibitors of PI3-K and p38 MAP kinase, respectively, blocked both the chemotactic and antiapoptotic activity of each of the peptides.
19920
20096
However, whereas (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 induced PI3-K and phospho-p38 expression in neutrophils, (Pro-Hyp-Gly)5 and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 had no effect on these proteins.
20097
20202
Peptides containing Hyp were also less potent chemoattractants than peptides containing only Pro and Gly.
20203
20356
These findings suggest that the relative chemotactic potency of these peptides may be related to their efficacy in upregulating PI3-K and p38 MAP kinase.
20357
20575
Alternatively, fMLP, (Pro-Pro-Gly)5, and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 may induce rapid alterations in the subcellular localization of PI3-K protein in neutrophils, leading to increased accessibility and detection by immunoblotting.
20576
20639
In contrast, this does not appear to be the case for apoptosis.
20640
20772
Thus, an inability to induce PI3-K or phospho-p38 MAP kinase had no effect on the antiapoptotic activity of Hyp-containing peptides.

The observation that the antiapoptotic effects of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)5 and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 were blocked by PI3-K and p38 MAP kinase inhibitors indicates that these signaling pathways are nevertheless essential for this response.
20996
21090
However, they appear to be activated distinctly by (Pro-Pro-Gly)n and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)n peptides.
21093
21272
Previous studies have suggested that PI3-K-mediated responses induced by chemoattractants involve mobilization of intracellular calcium through activation of phospholipase C [37].
21273
21378
Alterations in cytosolic Ca2+ are also important in inducing p38 MAP kinase activity in neutrophils [38].
21379
21573
In contrast, our findings indicate that synthetic peptide-induced activation of PI3-K and p38 MAP kinase, leading to chemotaxis and reduced apoptosis, occurs though calcium-independent pathways.
21574
21773
It is possible that phosphoinositides, or phosphorylated protein products of PI3-K or p38 MAP kinase, interact directly with actin-binding proteins, resulting in directed migration of the cells [39].
21774
22019
p38 MAP kinase is also known to phosphorylate proteins that may regulate chemotaxis and apoptosis by calcium-independent mechanisms, including MAP kinase-activated proteins 2, 3, and 5, as well as the transcription factors ATF-2 and CHOP-1 [40].
22022
22210
Signaling via PI3-K and p38 MAP kinase leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which is known to regulate genes involved in inflammatory responses to tissue injury [41].
22211
22348
NF-κB has been reported to be involved in chemoattractant-induced neutrophil activation as well as the suppression of apoptosis [22, 42].
22349
22533
Moreover, mice lacking the NF-κB subunit c-Rel are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis, and inhibition of NF-κB blocks neutrophil migration into damaged lungs in vivo [43, 44, 45].
22534
22657
We found that peptides containing collagen-related structural motifs induced NF-κB nuclear binding activity in neutrophils.
22658
22769
However, no significant differences in activity were observed based on the size or composition of the peptides.
22770
22998
These findings are consistent with the antiapoptotic effects of these synthetic peptides and suggest that the chemotactic and antiapoptotic effects of the peptides involve distinct signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation.

CONCLUSIONS
23014
23150
Polymeric polypeptides containing collagen-related structural motifs promote inflammation by inducing chemotaxis and blocking apoptosis.
23151
23250
However, distinct calcium-independent signaling pathways appear to be involved in these activities.
23251
23340
Neutrophil chemotaxis and apoptosis are a key to initiating and controlling inflammation.
23341
23539
The accumulation and persistence of these cells in tissues in response to protein fragments generated by invasive pathogens or by the degradation of connective tissue collagen may exacerbate injury.
23540
23687
An understanding of the mechanisms mediating these processes is essential in developing strategies for limiting maladaptive inflammatory responses.
