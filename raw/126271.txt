128
136
Abstract
138
346
Background: Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is linked to the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), and the HHV-8 DNA load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is associated with the clinical stage of KS.
347
738
To examine the expression of HHV-8 in PBMC, four HHV-8 mRNA specific NASBA assays were developedMethodsWe have developed four quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assays (NASBA-QT) specifically to detect mRNA coding for ORF 73 (latency-associated nuclear antigen, LANA), vGCR (a membrane receptor), vBcl-2 (a viral inhibitor of apoptosis) and vIL-6 (a viral growth factor).
739
853
The NASBA technique amplifies nucleic acids without thermocycling and mRNA can be amplified in a dsDNA background.
854
947
A molecular beacon is used during amplification to enable real-time detection of the product.
948
1037
The assays were tested on PBMC samples of two AIDS-KS patients from the Amsterdam Cohort.
1038
1215
Results: For all four assays, the limit of detection (LOD) of 50 molecules and the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 100 molecules were determined using in vitro transcribed RNA.
1216
1279
The linear dynamic range was 50 to 107 molecules of HHV-8 mRNA.
1280
1345
We found HHV-8 mRNA expression in 9 out of the 10 tested samples.
1346
1481
Conclusion: These real-time NASBA assays with beacon detection provide tools for further study of HHV-8 expression in patient material.

Background
1495
1660
Homosexual men infected with HIV-1 are at increased risk for developing AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS) due to co-infection with HHV-8, a gamma herpes virus.
1661
1778
Also known as Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus, HHV-8 was first discovered in 1994 in KS-affected tissue [1].
1779
1917
Since then it also has been associated with the development of multicentric Castleman's disease and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) [2-5].
1918
1986
HHV-8 DNA has been detected in both tissues and bodily fluids [6,7].
1987
2117
Studies initially focused on HHV-8 and its association with KS, transmission of HHV-8, and the natural history of HHV-8 infection.
2118
2297
As shown by Renwick et al. and Jacobsen et al. [8,9] seroconversion for HHV-8 during HIV infection increases the risk of developing KS, implying that HIV-1 has an impact on HHV-8.
2298
2494
Laboratory assays developed for the detection of HHV-8 include serologic assays such as immunofluorescence antibody assays [10-13], immunoblot assays [10], and various enzyme immunoassays [14-16].
2495
2556
PCR-based assays have also been used to detect HHV-8 DNA [1].
2557
2635
With the serologic assays, sensitivity and specificity are always problematic.
2636
2694
No single assay is completely sensitive and specific [17].
2697
2783
We would prefer a method using viral RNA or DNA as a marker for the presence of HHV-8.
2784
2952
Though DNA is an obvious choice because HHV-8 is a DNA virus, we have chosen RNA, because it indicates activity of the virus and may thus be a better prognostic marker.
2953
3001
Active infected cells produce more RNA than DNA.
3002
3109
In situ hybridisation has shown that most HHV-8 infected cells in KS lesions are latently infected [18,19].
3110
3194
but lytic HHV-8 infection is clearly present in a small proportion of cells [20-22].
3197
3241
A method for the detection of RNA is RT-PCR.
3242
3321
To increase sensitivity an additional amplification step can follow the RT-PCR.
3322
3607
This method is time consuming and also increases the likelihood of false positive reactions due to cross-contamination. Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) is a single-step isothermal RNA-specific amplification process [23] that amplifies mRNA in a dsDNA background [24].
3608
3761
NASBA has proved successful in the detection of various mRNAs [24-26] and in the detection of both viral [23] and bacterial [27] RNA in clinical samples.
3764
3941
By combining the standard NASBA technology [28] with a molecular beacon that anneals during amplification to the target sequence, a real-time detection system is generated [29].
3942
4157
This paper describes our development of real-time NASBA assays to quantify four functionally different genes of HHV-8: ORF 73, a latent gene, vGCR, a constitutively active gene, and the lytic genes vBcl-2 and vIL-6.
4158
4331
To normalise the input mRNA we developed a fifth NASBA for a constitutively expressed mRNA, U1A mRNA, and standardised the specific HHV8 mRNAs to the expression of U1A mRNA.
4334
4341
Methods
4343
4464
Our first assay was developed for ORF 73 and is based on the amplification of a 192 bp fragment situated within the gene.
4465
4553
ORF 73 encodes the major immunogenic latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) of HHV-8.
4554
4637
LANA is essential for maintenance of this virus in latently infected cells [30,31].
4638
4732
It is expressed only in such cells and thus gives a good indication of latent HHV-8 infection.
4733
4848
In addition, LANA interacts with the tumour suppressor protein p53 and represses its transcriptional activity [32].
4851
4952
Our second assay was developed for vGCR, G-protein coupled receptor, and amplifies a 168 bp fragment.
4953
5140
A receptor that binds several CXC and CC chemokines, vGCR appears to be constitutively active [33], although some studies indicate that it is expressed only during lytic replication [34].
5141
5256
It may contribute to the pathogenesis of KS by increasing the release of cellular growth factors such as VEGF [33].
5257
5340
It transforms rodent fibroblasts and induces expression of angiogenic factors [35].
5343
5410
The final two assays were developed for the genes vBcl-2 and vIL-6.
5411
5498
The assay for vBcl-2 amplifies a 216-bp fragment, and for vIL-6 the fragment is 186 bp.
5499
5610
vBcl-2 and vIL-6 are both early lytic genes, as their expression increases within 10 hours after induction [9].
5613
5775
vBcl-2 is a member of the Bcl-2 family, and functional studies indicate that vBcl-2 prevents Bax-mediated apoptosis and thus is an anti-apoptotic protein [36,37].
5776
5950
It is primarily active during lytic replication and its expression pattern suggests that it may function to prolong the survival of cells in which lytic infection is present.
5953
6109
vIL-6 is a secreted cytokine that maintains proliferation of IL-6-dependent mouse and human mycelia cell lines [21,38,39] and prevents apoptosis [21,38,40].
6112
6392
A NASBA reaction is based on the simultaneous activity of avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (RT), RNase H and T7 RNA polymerase with two oligonucleotide primers to produce amplification of the desired fragment more than 1012 fold in 90 to 120 minutes [23,41].
6393
6548
In a NASBA reaction, nucleic acids are a template for the amplification reaction only if they are single stranded and located in the primer-binding region.
6549
6716
Because the NASBA reaction is isothermal (41°C), specific amplification of ssRNA is possible if denaturation of dsDNA is prevented in the sample preparation procedure.
6717
6862
It is thus possible to pickup mRNA in a dsDNA background without getting false positive results caused by genomic dsDNA, in contrast with RT-PCR.
6863
6936
In figure 1 a schematic presentation of the NASBA amplification is given.
6937
7012
NASBA is achieved with the P1 (antisense) – P2 (sense) oligonucleotide set.
7013
7088
The overhang on P1 encodes the promoter sequence for the T7 RNA polymerase.
7089
7191
By using molecular beacons with the NASBA amplification a real-time detection system can be generated.
7192
7334
Molecular beacons are stem-and-loop-structured oligonucleotides with a fluorescent label at the 5' end and a universal quencher at the 3' end.
7335
7536
They are highly specific for their target and hybridise with their amplified target RNA when present in a NASBA amplification reaction to form a stable hybrid [42] at a relative low temperature (41°C).
7539
7626
The NASBA quantification method is based on a standard curve with a known input of RNA.
7627
7713
For this input we used in vitro RNA that was transcribed from four different plasmids.
7714
7877
These plasmids were generated by cloning a specific PCR product for each of the four target genes, using primer sets located on the borders of the different genes.
7878
8011
Primer sequences are shown in table 1. Input for the PCR was the nucleic acids of the BCP-1 cell line (a cell line containing HHV-8).
8012
8157
The sizes of the four different PCR fragments were 595 bp, 926 bp, 473 bp, and 589 bp for ORF 73, vGCR, vBcl-2 and vIL-6, respectively (table 1).
8158
8394
Each PCR fragment was cloned into the TOPO-TA plasmid (Invitrogen/ Lifetechnologies, Carlsbad, USA), and after all inserts were verified by sequencing, the fragments were cloned in a plasmide, pBluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA).
8395
8568
In vitro RNA was generated from these plasmids using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase, depending on the orientation of the fragment, and was treated with DNase to remove the plasmid.
8569
8698
The Q-RNA was purified by RNeasy (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), quantified spectrophotometrically, and checked by eye on agarose gel.
8699
8774
The resulting in vitro RNA was used for the four different standard curves.
8777
8909
NASBA amplification requires a sense and an anti-sense primer, and for real-time detection a unique beacon is added to the reaction.
8910
9211
We developed molecular beacons that could hybridise with the known sequences of the four HHV-8 genes, as shown in table 2. All the beacons have 6-fluorescine (6-FAM) as the fluorescent label at the 5' end and a (4-(dimethylamino) phenyl) azo) benzoic acid (Dabcyl) as universal quencher at the 3' end.
9212
9383
A BLAST analysis revealed that in each case, neither the primers nor the beacon shared significant homology with any known nucleotide sequences other than the target gene.
9384
9509
The quality of the different beacons was tested with a melting curve (from 80°C to 20°C) and acryl amide gel electrophoresis.
9512
9594
Each reaction consisted of 5 μl of the sample RNA and 10 μl of NASBA reaction mix.
9595
9772
This mix consisted of 80 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.5], 24 mM MgCl2, 140 mM KCl, 1.0 mM DTT, 2.0 mM of each dNTP, 4.0 mM each of ATP, UTP and CTP, 3.0 mM GTP, and 1.0 mM ITP in 30% DMSO.
9773
9898
This solution also contained the anti-sense and sense primers for amplification and the molecular beacons used for detection.
9899
9975
The final concentration for the primes was 0.1 μM and for the beacons 40 nM.
9978
10206
The reaction mixtures were incubated at 65°C for 5 min, and after cooling to 41°C for 5 min to allow for primer annealing, 5 μl of enzyme mix was added by pipetting into the lids of the microtubes and subsequently spinning down.
10207
10345
This mix contained, per reaction, 375 mM sorbitol, 2.1 μg BSA, 0.08 U RNase H, 32 U T7 RNA polymerase and 6.4 U AMV reverse transcriptase.
10346
10457
Reactions were incubated at 41°C for 120 min in a fluorometer (Cytofluor 4000; Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.).
10458
10546
The RNA amplicons generated in the NASBA process are detected by molecular beacons [29].
10547
10647
These beacons generate a fluorescent signal during amplification when hybridising with their target.
10648
10769
The fluorescence is measured continuously during amplification for real-time monitoring (i.e., as the reaction proceeds).
10770
10878
A threshold is determined by setting the fluorescence emitted in the first 5 measure points as a background.
10879
10989
The time-point at which a reaction rises above this threshold of detection and becomes positive is determined.
10990
11063
This time-to-positivity (TTP) principle is similar to real-time PCR [43].
11064
11178
A calibration curve with 50, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106 and 107 molecules HHV-8 mRNA was included in each experiment.
11179
11266
The number of mRNA copies per sample input can be extrapolated from the standard curve.
11267
11392
De Baar et al showed that it is possible to use ttp values for quantification without the use of an internal calibrator [44].
11395
11484
For standardisation of the amount of RNA input the U1A assay was used in each experiment.
11485
11550
U1A mRNA encodes for one of the proteins of the U1 snRNP [45,46].
11551
11675
Because U1A is constitutively expressed, the amount of U1A mRNA measured in the samples is an indication of total RNA input.
11676
11814
The mean of 6 assays (variation 0.6 log) was taken as the input RNA amount of the sample, and sample input RNA was normalised accordingly.
11815
11990
The NASBA conditions for the U1A assay were the same as those for the HHV-8 assay, with the exception of the final concentration of the primer (0.2 μM) and the beacon (50 nM).
11993
12137
The DNA fractions of the PBMC samples were tested for the presence of HHV-8 DNA using a nested PCR for ORF 73 described by Goudsmit et al. [47].
12138
12245
As a quantification of the amount of DNA input, a limited dilution PCR for the cellular CCR5 gene was used.
12246
12350
With limited dilution, an estimation of copies of HHV-8 DNA was made in relation to the amount of cells.
12351
12451
For both the ORF 73 and the CCR5 nested PCR, the detection level was 5 molecules input per reaction.
12454
12561
To test our assays in vivo, we selected PBMC samples from two participants of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies.
12562
12700
Described elsewhere in detail [48,49], they were both HIV-1-infected men with Kaposi's sarcoma but had very different disease development.
12701
12787
Patient 1 was a 30-year-old man who was demonstrated to be HIV-1-seropositive in 1995.
12788
12826
In July 1996 he was diagnosed with KS.
12827
12964
He did not respond to anti-retroviral or chemotherapy and died in January of 1997 as a result of severe infiltration of KS in both lungs.
12965
13091
Patient 2 is a 36-year-old man who visited our outpatient clinic in 1992 with an increasing number of KS-related skin lesions.
13092
13235
After he started anti-retroviral therapy several lesions disappeared and complete remission was gradually reached over the course of two years.
13236
13335
These two patients were chosen in large part for the diversity in their course of Kaposi's sarcoma.
13336
13459
We tested three samples for patient 1 and seven samples for patient 2 collected over time, all taken after diagnosis of KS.
13462
13650
After the frozen PBMC samples were thawed the cells were collected and resuspended in Trizol™ buffer to isolate RNA and DNA simultaneously, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
13651
13697
Precipitated RNA was redissolved in 50 μl H2O.
13698
13780
For each time-point, a known amount of cells (7.6–11.1 * 106 cells) were isolated.
13781
13940
With high input of total RNA we found that background RNA can disturb the amplification if present in large amounts and it was necessary to dilute the samples.
13941
14080
To have a broad range in the dilution for the RNA quantification in the NASBA experiments, the samples were diluted 10,100, and 1000 times.
14081
14170
Of these diluted samples 5 μl was used per reaction, and 10 μl of reaction mix was added.
14171
14275
U1A mRNA was used as an external standard to compare quantification signals among the different samples.
14278
14285
Results
14287
14524
These newly developed assays can be used quantitatively by testing a standard curve of samples with a known amount of mRNA molecules within the same experiment as the unknown samples, then extrapolating the results to the standard curve.
14525
14747
Typical amplification curves could be plotted in which an increase of fluorescence was observed until most of the molecular beacon had hybridised with the synthesised amplicons and the fluorescence reached a maximum level.
14750
14843
Such an amplification of in vitro synthesised ORF 73 RNA is shown in the insert in figure 2a.
14844
15106
The time-point at which the fluorescence signal became detectable over the background i.e., time-to-positivity (ttp), was linear over a range of at least six orders of magnitude of input RNA molecules, as shown by the dilution series of in vitro synthesised RNA.
15107
15232
In figure 2a the relationship between ttp values of the standard curve for ORF 73 and the log input of in vitro RNA is shown.
15233
15291
This relationship extended from 107 to 50 molecules input.
15294
15377
The dilution series of in vitro RNA showed a detection level of 50 molecules input.
15378
15458
For accurate quantification the required level is 102 molecules input per assay.
15459
15514
The line is calculated with linear regression analysis.
15515
15605
Besides the limit of detection (LOD), the limit of quantification (LOQ) can be determined.
15606
15703
For ORF 73, the LOD is 50 molecules input (84% pos.) while the LOQ is 102 molecules per reaction.
15704
15842
The linear quantification of the ORF 73 assay was determined to be between 102 to 107 copies RNA per reaction (R 2 = 0.96, p < 0.001, fig.
15843
15847
2a).
15848
15923
The sensitivity of all four assays was studied using five serial dilutions.
15924
16008
The linear regression analyses for the other assays are shown in figure 2b,2c,2d,2e.
16009
16169
The assay for vGCR has a very small standard deviation, and the amplification is linear from 107 to 50 molecules input per reaction (R 2 > 0.99, p < 0.001, fig.
16170
16174
2b).
16175
16252
The LOD is 50 molecules (55% pos.) and the LOQ is 102 molecules per reaction.
16253
16335
The assays for both vBcl-2 and vIL-6 are weaker but still within a workable range.
16336
16475
As above, the linear quantification was between 102 to 107 copies RNA per reaction (R 2 = 0.94 and R 2 = 0.95 respectively, p < 0.001, fig.
16476
16483
2c,2d).
16484
16542
For both assays, the LOD is 50 molecules (72% and 50% pos.
16543
16599
respectively) and the LOQ is 102 molecules per reaction.
16600
16693
U1A has a linear quantification range of 103 to 108 molecules (R2 = 0.99, p < 0.001, fig 2e).
16694
16823
The assay for U1A had a sensitivity of only 103 copies input/reaction, which is feasible due to the high expression level of U1A.
16826
16982
The specificity of the five assays was tested by spiking each reaction with 106 molecules of in vitro RNA that the primers and beacon were not designed for.
16983
17075
For example, ORF 73 in vitro RNA did not give a signal with the vGCR assay (data not shown).
17078
17248
In replicate independent experiments, the time-to-positivity (TTP) value had a linear relationship with the logarithm of the amount of in vitro RNA added in the reaction.
17249
17434
Subsequent experiments used serial 10-fold dilutions of in vitro RNA (from 107 to 102 and 50 molecules per reaction) as a standard curve to determine the amount of HHV-8 RNA in samples.
17435
17625
The experiments were done on different days and by different people with no significant variation in results, which confirmed the robustness of the assays and also their ease of performance.
17628
17814
To address the functionality and quality of the HHV-8 assays in vivo, they were tested on PBMC samples collected after KS diagnosis from two participants in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies.
17815
17857
In total, 10 frozen samples were analysed.
17858
18011
As a positive control, all samples were tested for the presence of HHV-8 DNA with a nested PCR and were found to be positive (see Materials and Methods).
18012
18089
The copies of HHV-8 DNA varied between 2 and 2 * 102 per 103 cells (table 3).
18090
18193
A relation has been shown between the HHV-8 DNA levels in PBMC and the extent of Kaposi's sarcoma [50].
18194
18279
A possible correlation between DNA levels and mRNA expression should be investigated.
18282
18424
The results of the HHV-8 assays are shown in table 3. Of the 10 samples, 9 were positive for ORF 73, whereas only half were positive for vGCR.
18425
18531
While vBcl-2 was measured in 9 out of 10 samples, vIL-6 was detected in approximately half of the samples.
18532
18608
All the samples that were positive for ORF 73 were also positive for vBcl-2.
18609
18695
Surprisingly the samples were positive for a latent and a lytic gene at the same time.
18696
18794
The variation in expression levels is large both among the different assays and among the samples.
18795
18927
No clear trend in the expression of HHV-8-specific mRNA can be distinguished, based on HHV-8 DNA levels, patient, or disease status.
18930
18940
Discussion
18942
19020
In general the NASBA assay has several advantages over the PCR technique [51].
19021
19169
The amplification procedure of the NASBA assay is entirely isothermal and is conducted at 41°C; it does not require thermal cycling instrumentation.
19170
19271
The NASBA product is single-stranded and can therefore be readily detected by hybridisation analysis.
19274
19453
Our four real-time NASBA assays offer these benefits and also the five features that define validation of any assay: accuracy, sensitivity, precision, robustness, and specificity.
19454
19527
With the use of standard curves in each experiment, accuracy is achieved.
19528
19587
The sensitivity is determined with a linear standard curve.
19588
19670
The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) are determined.
19671
19773
For all the HHV-8 assays, the LOD is 50 molecules per reaction and LOQ was 100 molecules per reaction.
19774
19876
To achieve linear amplification requires at least 5 concentrations on the linear portion of the curve.
19877
19977
For the HHV-8 assays, the linear range spans 7 concentrations and for U1A it spans 6 concentrations.
19978
20103
Quantification was achieved within this linear range of at least six orders of magnitude (102 to 107 molecules per reaction).
20104
20229
Within this linear range quantification of at least six orders of magnitude (102 to 107 molecules per reaction) was achieved.
20232
20332
The precision of the assays was measured as the standard deviation and the confidence interval (fig.
20333
20336
2).
20337
20410
We used 5 replicates of 7 different concentrations of the standard curve.
20411
20506
Robustness was determined by having different people perform the experiments on different days.
20507
20554
Specificity was shown with spiking experiments.
20555
20636
The lower detection level of the assays was approximately 50 copies per reaction.
20637
20733
The assays work equally well in vivo as in vitro e.g., for quantification of HHV-8 RNA in PBMCs.
20736
20911
The onset of KS is associated with a high HHV-8 load in PBMC [19] and this indicates that HHV-8 infected circulating cells play an important role in KS development [20,52,53].
20912
21026
HHV-8 can infect circulating B cells, monocytes/macrophages, T cells and KS-like spindle cell progenitors [54-56].

In KS lesions B cells are rare or absent, but monocytes macrophages are abundantly present [52], this suggest that circulating monocytes may recruit the virus into tissues or transmit the virus to other cells.
21237
21396
Since lymphocytes and monocytes infiltrating KS lesions can be productively infected by HHV-8 [20,22], it is important to look at active infection in the PBMC.
21397
21485
PBMCs of two AIDS-KS patients were selected and analysed for the presence of HHV-8 mRNA.
21488
21633
In 90% of our samples, ORF 73 mRNA and vBcl-2 mRNA were detected, whereas for vIL-6 mRNA and vGCR mRNA were present in 60% and 50%, respectively.
21634
21688
The expression levels of all four genes varied widely.
21689
21865
Comparing the different expression levels of the four HHV-8 genes within one sample or comparing expression levels of one gene in one patient did not show an apparent tendency.
21866
21959
No clear trend can be distinguished based on the HHV-8 DNA levels, patient or disease status.
21960
22099
Nevertheless the finding of expression of different HHV8 specific genes in PBMCs is notable in itself, as it has not been described before.
22100
22184
HHV-8 RNA has been found in tissues, endothelial cells and spindle cells [18,57,58].
22185
22267
In 90% of fresh KS-affected tissues, HHV-8 RNA has been detected with RT-PCR [59].
22268
22409
In situ hybridisation and LANA immunohistochemistry have confirmed HHV-8 gene expression in KS spindle cells within KS lesions [18,58,60-62].
22410
22515
Expression of lytic HHV-8 genes has also been documented in monocytes and macrophages in KS lesions [20].

Conclusion
22530
22631
The assays that were developed work well for the detection and quantification of HHV-8 specific mRNA.
22632
22796
Although no clear trend in the expression pattern could be distinguished the finding of expression of different HHV8 specific genes in PBMCs is important in itself.
22797
22861
As this suggests that HHV-8 replication takes place in the PBMC.
22862
22912
The PBMCs we used were obtained from two patients.
22913
23045
To draw conclusions about the clinical and prognostic utility of these assays more patients and patient samples need to be analysed.
23046
23253
However, as the assays are able to quantify HHV-8 mRNA in PBMC samples we feel that these real-time NASBA assays with beacon detection provide tools for further study of HHV-8 expression in patient material.
