Stage-specific changes in fetal thymocyte proliferation during the CD4-8- to CD4+8+ transition in wild type, Rag1-/-, and Hoxa3,Pax1 mutant mice
146

Abstract
156
313
Background: The function of the thymic microenvironment is to promote thymocyte maturation, in part via regulation of thymocyte proliferation and cell death.
314
560
Defects in fetal thymic epithelial cell (TEC) development and function, and therefore in the formation of a functional microenvironment, can be caused either directly by TEC differentiation defects or indirectly by defective thymocyte maturation.
561
723
In this paper we studied fetal thymocyte proliferation during the early transition from the CD3-4-8- (triple negative, TN) to CD4+8+ (double positive, DP) stages.
724
879
We compared wild type mice with Rag1-/- mice and with Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- compound mutant mice, which have blocks at different stages of thymocyte development.
880
1079
Results: Wild type fetal and adult thymus showed stage-specific differences in the proliferation profiles of developing thymocytes, with fetal stages showing generally higher levels of proliferation.
1080
1339
The proliferation profile of fetal thymocytes from Rag1-/- mutants also had stage-specific increases in proliferation compared to wild type fetal thymocytes, in contrast to the lower proliferation previously reported for thymocytes from adult Rag1-/- mutants.
1340
1518
We have previously shown that Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- mice have abnormal fetal TEC development, resulting in increased apoptosis at the TN to DP transition and decreased DP cell numbers.
1519
1650
Fetal thymocytes from Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- compound mutants had increased proliferation, but fewer proliferating cells, at the DP stage.
1651
1878
We also observed a decrease in the level of the cytokines IL-7 and SCF produced by Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/-TECs. Conclusion: Our results indicate complex and stage-specific effects of abnormal TEC development on thymocyte proliferation.

Background
1892
2046
Thymocyte development occurs within a complex network of cells, extracellular matrix, and secreted factors referred to as the thymic microenvironment [1].
2047
2269
Current evidence suggests that this microenvironment is created during fetal thymus organogenesis through stage-dependent interactions between differentiating thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and developing thymocytes [2-6].
2270
2400
Therefore, blocks at different stages of thymocyte development result in differential effects on TEC differentiation and function.
2401
2637
Because of the complex interdependence of TEC and thymocyte differentiation, defects in fetal TEC development can be caused either directly by cell-autonomous TEC differentiation defects, or indirectly by defective thymocyte maturation.
2638
2780
Once a mature thymic environment is formed, many, if not all stages of thymocyte maturation require interactions with thymic epithelial cells.
2781
2893
Therefore, defects in TECs can in turn cause defects in thymocyte differentiation, proliferation, or cell death.
2896
2953
Thymocyte differentiation undergoes two main transitions.
2954
3050
The first is from the CD3-4-8- (triple negative, TN) to the CD4+8+ (double positive, DP) stages.
3051
3242
During this transition, T cell precursors sequentially gain and lose cell surface expression of CD44 and CD25 markers, express the pre-T cell receptor (pTCR), and undergo β-selection [2,7-9].
3243
3508
The other transition is from CD4+8+ DP to CD4+ or CD8+ single positive (SP) thymocytes, in which DP cells express CD3, rearrange their α-TCR, undergo positive and negative selection, and down regulate CD4 or CD8 to become functional CD8+ or CD4+ SP T cells [10,11].
3509
3680
In addition to functional and cell surface marker changes, each thymocyte differentiation stage is marked by characteristic changes in proliferation and apoptosis [12-18].
3683
3843
The most well defined role for TECs in directly affecting thymocyte differentiation is to mediate positive selection via expression of MHC molecules [11,19-22].
3844
4095
However, it is still unclear whether TECs directly promote specific stages of thymocyte differentiation during stages that do not involve MHC-TCR interactions, or whether their role at other stages is primarily to promote cell growth and /or survival.
4096
4330
Cytokines produced by TECs have been shown to promote proliferation in early stages of thymocyte development, and have been proposed to regulate apoptosis and differentiation, although their precise roles remain controversial [23,24].
4331
4438
TECs have also been shown to promote thymocyte proliferation in SP cells after selection has occurred [15].
4439
4512
However, a defined role for TECs at the TN-DP transition remains elusive.
4513
4592
Much of the research on this transition has focused on the role of the pre-TCR.
4593
4928
Mounting evidence suggests that the pre-TCR does not require interaction with a ligand to perform its function, and the subsequent CD44-25- (TN4 or pre-DP) to DP transition has been termed "programmed differentiation" to indicate that this step can occur in isolated thymocytes, presumably without input from extrinsic signals [25-27].
4929
5126
However, there is also evidence that the thymic microenvironment does contribute signals required for the TN-DP transition, particularly to promote thymocyte proliferation and apoptosis [13,28-30].
5127
5251
The specific nature and purpose of the TEC contribution during this important transition therefore remains to be determined.
5254
5380
In order to investigate the regulation of thymocyte development by TECs, we are studying Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- compound mutant mice.
5381
5533
Hoxa3 and Pax1 are transcription factors that act in a common pathway regulating thymus organogenesis and thymic epithelial cell development [29,31-34].
5534
5707
Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- compound mutants have defects in TEC development including reduced numbers of TECs, fewer MHC Class II+ TECs, and changes in TEC proliferation and apoptosis.
5708
5940
These TEC defects result in thymocyte maturation defects that include a decrease in total thymocyte number and a 10-fold reduction in the number of DP thymocytes, but an apparently normal transition from the TN3 to the pre-DP stage.
5941
6038
The decrease in DP cells is associated with increased apoptosis in both pre-DP and DP cells [29].
6039
6267
As the defects at the TN to DP transition in these mutants are caused by defective TEC function rather than thymocyte-intrinsic defects, these mice represent an opportunity to study the role of TECs in promoting this transition.
6270
6506
To further investigate the role of TECs in promoting thymocyte death and growth during the TN to DP transition, we assayed the proliferation of specific thymocyte subsets using BrdU incorporation, which detects cycling cells in S-phase.
6507
6591
We compared fetal and adult wild type mice with Hoxa3,Pax1 compound mutants [29,34].
6592
6719
We also assayed Rag1-/- mice, which have defects in TEC development due to arrested thymocyte maturation at the TN3 stage [35].
6720
6825
We found stage-specific differences in proliferation levels between fetal and adult wild type thymocytes.
6826
6923
We also found distinct patterns of thymocyte proliferation in the Rag1-/- and Hoxa3,Pax1 mutants.
6924
7148
The abnormal cell death and proliferation patterns in the Hoxa3,Pax1 compound mutant fetal thymocytes might be caused in part by observed reductions in the transcription levels of the cytokines IL-7 and SCF produced by TECs.
7149
7364
Our results support a critical role for microenvironment created by TECs in regulating thymocyte proliferation during the TN to DP transition, and show that this function is disrupted in Hoxa3,Pax1 compound mutants.
7367
7374
Results
7376
7524
As an initial analysis, we compared thymocyte proliferation between thymocytes from late fetal (E17.5) and adult (6–8 week) wild type C57BL6/J mice.
7525
7713
Although differences in the proliferation of fetal vs. adult TCR-expressing thymocytes and have been reported [36], we were interested in investigating the more immature thymocyte subsets.
7714
7885
BrdU labeled fetal and adult thymi were analyzed for the percent of proliferating cells in different CD3-4-8- TN thymocyte subsets defined by CD44 and CD25 expression [8].
7886
7968
The CD3+4+8+ population was defined by co-staining of all three markers (Fig. 1A).
7969
8105
A typical analysis of the BrdU+ cells in DP cells and the four CD44 vs. CD25 subsets within the TN cell population is shown in Figure 1.
8106
8177
Compiled data for each subset from all experiments is shown in Table 1.
8180
8321
The wild type adult (Fig. 1C, 1F) and fetal (Fig. 1D, 1F) thymocyte proliferation profile patterns differed significantly at specific stages.
8322
8418
The overall proliferation level in TN cells was increased by 50% in fetal thymocytes (p < 0.01).
8419
8603
Most dramatically, the percentages of BrdU+ cells in fetal thymocytes were 10-fold higher than in the adult at the earliest, TN1 (CD44+25-) thymocyte differentiation stage (P < 0.001).
8604
8702
A much lower, but still significant increase was seen in fetal TN2 cells (25% increase, p < 0.01).
8703
8813
Proliferation was also significantly higher at the fetal TN3 stage compared to adult (50% increase, p < 0.01).
8814
8910
Proliferation at the TN4/pre-DP (CD44-25-) stage was similar between fetal and adult thymocytes.
8911
9024
In contrast, DP cells showed a 3-fold increase in proliferation in the fetal thymus relative to adult (p < 0.01).
9025
9177
Therefore, nearly every stage from the earliest TN to the DP stages showed significantly increased proliferation in fetal thymocytes relative to adults.
9180
9417
It was possible that the lower percentage of proliferating cells seen in the TN1 population in adults was due to an increased number of B cells and NK cells in the adult thymus, which would not have been excluded in our initial analysis.
9418
9622
As this was one of the most striking differences seen between fetal and adult stages, we repeated this analysis adding antibodies against B220 and NK1.1 to CD3, 4 and 8 in the excluded gate (Fig. 1G, 1H).
9623
9810
Even excluding these cell populations, there is still a significantly lower percentage of proliferating cells in the TN1 population in the adult thymus than in the fetal thymus (Fig. 1I).
9811
9918
Therefore, this difference is not due to different numbers of B and NK cells in the adult vs. fetal thymus.
9921
10034
We also compared proliferation of fetal thymocytes from Rag1-/- mice to the results obtained from wild type mice.
10035
10226
Thymocytes in the adult Rag1-/- thymus have been previously shown to have overall lower levels of proliferation than adult wild type TN thymocytes [13], particularly at the TN3 stage [37-40].
10227
10397
At fetal stages, our results showed that proliferation also varied between thymocytes in the wild type and Rag1-/- thymus at discrete stages of thymocyte differentiation.
10398
10534
At the earliest TN1 stage, thymocyte proliferation levels in Rag1-/- thymi were similar to fetal wild type cells (Fig. 1E, 1F; Table 1).
10535
10674
At the TN2 stage, fetal thymocytes from Rag1-/- mice had a proliferation level nearly twice that of wild type fetal thymocytes (p < 0.001).
10675
10883
By the TN3 stage, the percentage of proliferating Rag1-/- thymocytes had dropped slightly below that of wild type fetal thymocytes (~30% decrease, p < 0.01), equal to wild type adult TN3 proliferation levels.
10884
11052
In addition, the percentages of BrdU+ cells in TN1 and TN2 subsets in the Rag1-/- fetal thymus were significantly higher than those of the wild type adults (P < 0.001).
11053
11259
These results with Rag1-/- fetal thymocytes contrast with thymocytes in the Rag-/- adult, which have much lower proliferation than wild type adult thymocytes at all stages of thymocyte differentiation [13].
11262
11525
Our previous analysis of the Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- compound mutant thymocyte phenotype showed a specific partial block at the TN to DP transition, associated with increased apoptosis at both the TN4/pre-DP and DP subsets, and a 10-fold decrease in DP cell numbers [29].
11526
11676
Using BrdU analysis, we compared the proliferation of Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- fetal thymocytes during the TN to DP transition compared to littermate controls.
11677
11972
Thymocyte proliferation levels for all genotypes (Hoxa3+/-,Pax1+/-, Pax1-/-, and Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/-) were similar to wild type in all of the canonical TN1-TN4 stages (Fig. 2A,2B,2C; Table 1), consistent with the normal percentages and cell numbers for these subpopulations previously reported [29].
11973
12266
Recent papers by Penit, et al. have provided data from cell cycle analysis suggesting that a discrete CD44-25lo population with a specific proliferation profile can be identified, such that the transition from TN3 to DP can be further subdivided into CD25hi, CD25lo, and CD25- subsets [12,13].
12267
12425
Analysis of proliferation using these more narrowly defined subsets still showed values similar to wild type in the CD44-25lo subset (Fig. 2D,2E,2F; Table 2).
12426
12564
In contrast, the proliferation level of DP cells increased nearly 2-fold in compound mutants compared to wild type (Fig. 2C, 2F; Table 1).
12565
12763
In spite of this increase in the percentage of proliferating cells, the actual number of BrdU+ DP cells was reduced 4-fold compared to wild type in the compound mutants (15.03 ± 8.73 × 104 vs. 61.94
12764
12802
± 32.12 × 104 in wild type; p < 0.01).
12803
12885
The numbers of proliferating cells at the pre-DP stage were unchanged (not shown).
12886
13070
Combined with our previous results, this result shows that both increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation contribute to the decrease in DP cells in the Hoxa3,Pax1 compound mutants.
13071
13194
Unfortunately, Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- mice die at birth, preventing analysis of thymocyte proliferation in adult compound mutants.
13197
13365
Cytokines produced by TECs are good candidates for mediating at least some of these changes in thymocyte proliferation and apoptosis in the Hoxa3,Pax1 compound mutants.
13366
13532
Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, we analyzed the expression of two cytokines that are produced by TECs, IL-7 and SCF, in pooled, genotype-matched E14.5 thymi (Fig. 3).
13533
13678
Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- compound mutants had decreased transcription of both cytokines relative to all other genotypes, including Pax1-/- single mutants.
13679
13836
However, Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- compound mutants were not completely missing either cytokine analyzed, and the magnitude of the decrease was variable between pools.
13839
14050
To test whether the changes in cytokine levels were responsible for the observed thymocyte development phenotypes, we attempted to rescue these phenotypes by supplementation in fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC).
14051
14172
E15.5 embryonic thymic lobes from individual embryos were cultured separately in FTOC, with or without added IL-7 or SCF.
14173
14473
Cultures from control genotypes (wild type, Pax1+/-, Hoxa3+/-, Pax1-/-) behaved as expected [41-46], with addition of IL-7 causing an increase in the percentage of DN cells and a corresponding decrease in DP cells, while adding SCF had no significant effect on thymocyte development (data not shown).
14474
14604
However, to our surprise the two separated lobes from Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- compound mutants did not always develop in predictable ways.
14605
14733
In fact, separated lobes cultured under identical conditions in the absence of any added cytokines had widely differing results.
14734
14968
Changes in thymocyte cell number and differentiation after culture were highly variable; for example, cell numbers could differ stochastically after culture by as much as 10-fold between two lobes from the same compound mutant embryo.
14969
15130
This result was never obtained with separately cultured thymic lobes from any other genotype, which always developed identically when cultured without cytokines.
15131
15316
This property of the compound mutant thymic lobes probably reflects phenotypic variability previously seen in our histological and gross morphological analysis of these mutants [29,34].
15319
15329
Discussion
15331
15427
In this study, we have examined thymocyte proliferation in the fetal and adult wild type thymus.
15428
15581
Our results showed clear stage-specific differences in wild type thymocyte proliferation depending on the developmental age of the microenvironment (i.e.
15582
15599
fetal vs. adult).
15600
15794
We also analyzed two mutant strains that have either cell-autonomous (Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/-) or non-cell-autonomous (Rag1-/-) TEC defects, with blocks at different stages of thymocyte differentiation.
15795
16019
Abnormal TEC development in both of these mutant strains resulted in both increases and decreases in thymocyte proliferation in a stage-specific manner, rather than simply an overall reduced ability to promote proliferation.
16022
16207
There is considerable evidence that thymopoiesis differs in the fetal thymus during the initial creation of the microenvironment, as opposed to adult thymus function (reviewed in [47]).
16208
16397
Differences have been reported in responses to some cytokines, in signaling at the TN-DP transition in fetal compared to adult thymus, and in proliferation of CD4+ SP thymocytes [36,48-50].
16398
16600
The proliferation profiles of both wild type and Rag-/- fetal thymocytes support the hypothesis that fetal thymocyte maturation is fundamentally different from thymocyte development in the adult thymus.
16601
16706
The TN1 and DP stages both show increased proliferation in wild-type fetal thymocytes compared to adults.
16707
16809
This difference at the TN1 stage is not due to the presence of more B or NK cells in the adult thymus.
16810
17025
Although it is formally possible that some other cell type may still be included in our TN1 population, this analysis strongly suggests that TN1 cells have different proliferation profiles in fetal and adult thymus.
17028
17313
It has been well documented that thymocytes in adult Rag1 or Rag2 mutants have dramatically reduced proliferation compared to wild type, particularly at the TN3 stage [37-40], and Penit et al. reported 2–10 fold reductions at every stage of thymocyte development in Rag-/- adults [13].
17314
17508
Recent work by Petrie, et al. has shown that this reduced proliferation is not intrinsic to Rag mutant thymocytes, but rather is secondary to thymic microenvironment defects in Rag mutants [37].
17509
17757
Our results show that at fetal stages, Rag mutant thymocytes have a proliferation profile that is much more similar to wild type thymocytes at the same stage, with less than a 2-fold difference in the percentage of proliferating cells at any stage.
17758
17980
For example, TN3 stage thymocytes in the Rag-/- adult thymus have proliferation levels 3-fold below wild type thymus [13,37], while in the Rag-/- fetal thymus TN3 cells are only 25–30% lower than in wild type fetal thymus.
17981
18090
Proliferation is not changed at all stages, and is actually increased relative to wild type at the TN2 stage.
18091
18369
This increase at the TN2 stage may be due to the failure of TN2 cells to initiate TCRβ gene rearrangement at this stage, which is normally associated with decreased proliferation.Rag-/- mutants have a profound thymocyte development block at the TN3 to TN4/preDP transition [51].
18370
18507
During normal wild type fetal thymus development, significant DP cell development does not occur until E16.5 in most genetic backgrounds.
18508
18742
As a result, at E17.5 the thymic microenvironment in Rag mutants has not been exposed to abnormal thymocyte development for very long, and has not yet developed the full phenotype seen in the steady state adult Rag mutant thymus [35].
18745
18938
In the Hoxa3,Pax1 compound mutants, cell-autonomous TEC defects cause a partial block at the DN-DP transition, so thymocytes do progress to DP and SP stages, albeit at reduced frequencies [29].
18939
19043
TEC defects are seen as early as E12.5 in these mutants, from the earliest stages of organogenesis [34].
19044
19176
Therefore, the TEC defects in these mice would be expected to have different effects on thymocyte proliferation than in Rag mutants.
19177
19267
In this study, we found stage-specific changes in thymocyte proliferation at the DP stage.
19268
19403
Our previous analysis reported decreased DP cell number and increased apoptosis in both the pre-DP and DP stages in these mutants [29].
19404
19519
DP cell numbers in both this and our previous study were decreased 10-fold in the Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- compound mutants.
19520
19647
At first glance, the increase in the percentage of proliferating cells at the DP stage appears contradictory to this phenotype.
19648
19761
However, this increase actually corresponds to decreased numbers of proliferating DP cells compared to wild type.
19762
20024
In contrast, pre-DP cells did not have a change in the number or percentage of proliferating cells, suggesting that the signals promoting proliferation of these cells is still present, and that proliferation of DP and pre-DP cells may be regulated independently.
20025
20171
Pre-DP cells do have a three-fold increase in apoptosis [29], suggesting that separate signals regulate proliferation and survival of these cells.
20172
20444
Combined with our previous data, this result suggests that the decrease in DP cell numbers seen in the Hoxa3-Pax1 compound mutants is both due to an increase in the number of pre-DP and DP cells undergoing apoptosis as well as a decrease in the number of proliferating DP.
20447
20611
Insufficiencies of multiple cytokines might be involved in the changes in proliferation and cell death at the CD44-25- and DP stages in Hoxa3-Pax1 compound mutants.
20612
20754
SCF and IL-7 are first expressed as early as E12.5 in the developing thymus, well before significant thymocyte maturation takes place [52,53].
20755
20932
Although the number of TECs is reduced by about 2-fold in Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- compound mutants, the number of thymocytes is reduced by a slightly greater amount, around 3-fold [29].
20933
21073
Therefore, the reductions seen in cytokine message levels in the Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/-compound mutants are not secondary to decreased TEC numbers.
21074
21241
In fact, these mutants should have a relative increase in the proportion of TECs, making the reductions seen in cytokine levels in the mutant thymi even more striking.
21242
21484
The reduced expression of these cytokines in Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- compound mutants could be an indirect effect of defective TEC differentiation, or could be direct downstream targets since both Hoxa3 and Pax1 are expressed in fetal thymus [54,55].
21485
21708
Comparison of the Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- phenotype with those of cytokine mutants do not reveal many similarities [30,46,56-61], probably because of the simultaneous reductions in multiple cytokines in the Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- mutants.
21709
21789
For example, SCF and IL-7 have been shown to have synergistic functions [62,63].
21790
21960
Therefore, changes in multiple cytokines in Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- mutants would be expected to have complex effects on thymocyte development that could be difficult to predict.
21963
22095
Interpretation of the observed phenotype is further complicated by the fact that none of the cytokines tested are completely absent.
22096
22311
A striking example is the complete absence of γδTCR+ thymocyte development in IL-7 mutants, in contrast to normal γδTCR+ cell development in Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- mutants [29], which have dramatically reduced IL-7 levels.
22312
22430
This result suggests that although γδTCR+ cell development requires IL-7, low levels are sufficient for this function.
22431
22635
Therefore, analysis of mutants with low levels of cytokines may provide a system for uncovering both dosage-dependent requirements and later functions for these factors in promoting thymocyte development.
22636
22810
It is also possible that some of the differences seen between Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- and cytokine mutant phenotypes reflect different effects of cytokines at fetal and adult stages.
22811
23018
Studies of IL-7R mutants showed relatively normal thymocyte maturation at fetal stages, albeit with reduced thymocyte numbers, in contrast to a severe block in thymocyte differentiation in adult thymus [49].
23019
23178
Analysis of cytokine mutants during fetal stages could therefore reveal a more complete picture of the role of these cytokines during fetal thymus development.
23181
23192
Conclusions
23194
23388
Our results show that fetal and adult wild type thymocytes have stage-specific differences in proliferation, with both TN1 and DP cells exhibiting higher levels of proliferation in fetal thymus.
23389
23516
This fetal wild-type profile was very similar to that seen for fetal Rag mutant thymocytes, in contrast to adult Rag-/- thymus.
23517
23726
Therefore, the changes in proliferation seen in the fetal Rag mutant thymocytes reflect the earliest microenvironment changes occurring as a result of defective TEC-thymocyte interactions in the Rag-/- thymus.
23729
23959
The current study further supports a role for TECs in regulating both thymocyte proliferation and survival during the DN-DP transition, and suggests that proliferation and apoptosis of TN4 and DP cells are regulated independently.
23960
24166
Our results provide direct genetic evidence for these functions of TECs, by showing that these processes are defective in mutants with a primary TEC differentiation defect (the Hoxa3,Pax1 compound mutants).
24167
24276
Taken together, our results further define the role TECs play at this complex stage of thymocyte development.

Fetal thymocyte in vivo BrdU incorporation was done by intraperitoneal injection of BrdU (5-Bromo-2'-Deoxyuridine; Sigma) on the morning of E17.5, two doses per mouse and 1 mg per dose with a 0.5 hour pause, as previously described [13].
25058
25221
Two hours after the first injection, fetal thymi were isolated by dissection and single-cell suspensions prepared by passing the thymocytes through cell strainers.
25222
25343
Adult thymocyte in vivo BrdU incorporation was done by the same injection protocol using 6–8 week old C57BL/6 adult mice.

Data were collected by selectively gating either CD3-4-8- or CD3+4+8+ populations (Becton Dickinson dual laser FACSCalibur), and analyses were performed with Cellquest software.
26353
26444
Significant differences were determined by the unpaired Student's t-test or ANOVA analysis.
26447
26553
E14.5 fetal thymic lobes were collected and stored in the TRIzol (GIBCO BRL) at -70°C until RNA isolation.
26554
26707
Pools of 5-to10 thymi from embryos of the same genotype were homogenized using Micro Pellet Pestles (Nalge Nunc International) in 1.5 ml-eppendorf tubes.
26708
26846
RNA was isolated and the genomic DNA was depleted by using DNaseI (Amplification Grade, GIBCO BRL) following the manufacturer's protocols.
26847
26978
Reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA to cDNA was done using SuperScript II following the manufacturer's protocol (GIBCO BRL).
26979
27105
Equal amounts of cDNA from different genotypes were added to a final 20 μl PCR reaction mixture using the QIAGEN Taq PCR kits.
27106
27295
PCR conditions were: 94°C 30 sec, 50°C 1 min, 72°C 1 min for IL-7, SCF and their internal control β-actin; or 94°C 30 sec, 60°C 1 min, 72°C 1 min for TGFβ1 and its internal control β-actin.
27296
27392
PCR products were visualized by 5% acrylamide gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.
27393
27518
Band densities were measured and analyzed using the Molecular Analyst software package (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Version 1.4.1).
27519
27930
Primer sequences were: IL-7 [65]: IL-7 (5') 5'ACT ACA CCC ACC TCC CGC A3'; IL-7 (3') 5'TCT CAG TAG TCT CTT TAG G3'; SCF [65]: SCF (5') 5'TCT TCA ACT GCT CCT ATT T3'; SCF (3') 5'ACT GCT ACT GCT GTC ATT C3'; TGFβ1 [66]: TGFβ1(5') 5'GCG GAC TAC TAT GCT AAA GAG G3'; TGFβ1(3') 5'GTT GTG TTG GTT GTA GAG GGC A3'; β-actin [67]: β-actin (5') 5'GGG TCA GAA GGA CTC CTA TG3'; β-actin (3') 5'GTA ACA ATG CCA TGT TCA AT3'.
27933
27980
Thymic lobes were dissected from E15.5 embryos.
27981
28095
The two lobes from each embryo cultured separately in high oxygen submersion culture as previously described [41].
28096
28230
Fetal thymic organ cultures were supplemented with 100 u/ml of IL-7 or 20 ng/ml of SCF (Pepro Tech Inc.) as previously described [41].
28231
28363
For each embryo, one lobe was treated while the other was cultured in parallel without supplemental cytokine as an internal control.
28364
28463
In control experiments, lobes were cultured separately under identical conditions without cytokine.
28464
28600
After five days in culture, the cells were stained by PE-anti-mouse CD4 and FITC-anti-mouse CD8 and analyzed by flow cytometry as above.

Figure 1: DNA synthesis patterns of fetal vs. adult thymocyte subsets as measured by incorporation of BrdU A. Thymocytes were gated as either CD3-4-8- TN or CD3+4+8+ DP by cell surface marker expression and forward scatter (SP cells should be located between these two gates, and therefore excluded from analysis).
