Abstract
112
351
Background: The expression of gene batteries, genomic units of functionally linked genes which are activated by similar sets of cis- and trans-acting regulators, has been proposed as a major determinant of cell specialization in metazoans.
352
487
We developed a predictive procedure to screen the mouse and human genomes and transcriptomes for cases of gene-battery-like regulation.
488
691
Results: In a screen that covered ~40 per cent of all annotated protein-coding genes, we identified 21 co-expressed gene clusters with statistically supported sharing of cis-regulatory sequence elements.
692
1081
66 predicted cases of over-represented transcription factor binding motifs were validated against the literature and fell into three categories: (i) previously described cases of gene battery-like regulation, (ii) previously unreported cases of gene battery-like regulation with some support in a limited number of genes, and (iii) predicted cases that currently lack experimental support.
1082
1330
The novel predictions include for example Sox 17 and RFX transcription factor binding sites that were detected in ~10% of all testis specific genes, and HNF-1 and 4 binding sites that were detected in ~30% of all kidney specific genes respectively.
1331
1369
The results are publicly available at.
1370
1484
Conclusion: 21 co-expressed gene clusters were enriched for a total of 66 shared cis-regulatory sequence elements.
1485
1599
A majority of these predictions represent novel cases of potential co-regulation of functionally coupled proteins.

1737
Critical technical parameters were evaluated, and the results and the methods provide a valuable resource for future experimental design.

Background
1751
1931
To understand how gene expression is coordinated to produce hundreds of cell phenotypes from an identical complement of genes is a principal challenge in mammalian genome research.
1932
2231
A commonly suggested model for terminal differentiation in metazoans is that the core features of the cellular phenotype are mediated by a set of genes that is regulated as a gene battery, i.e. a set of functionally coupled genes that are activated by similar cis- and trans-acting regulators [1-3].
2232
2449
Although the gene battery is an idealized concept, concrete examples of gene battery-like regulation have been found in for example muscle subtypes [4-7], megakaryocytes [8], the epidermis [9] and lymphocytes [10,11].
2452
2608
A key step in the elucidation of gene battery-like regulation is to detect and functionally test the cis regulatory elements that mediate the co-regulation.
2609
2677
A number of computation-based methods have been proposed to do this.
2678
2787
In micro-organisms, computational methods have proven useful to detect modules of co-regulated genes [12,13].
2788
3050
In mammals, predictive models based on assumed co-regulation at the cis level have been constructed for liver- and skeletal muscle-selective gene regulation [14,15], and general tools have been developed for the regulatory analysis of co-expressed genes [16-18].
3053
3323
The aim of this work is to screen the mouse and human genomes and transcriptomes for instances where sharing of cis-regulatory sequences is statistically coupled to conserved co-expression of genes, i.e. cases that fall within or near the idealized gene battery concept.
3324
3484
Another aim is to critically investigate technical parameters in order to maximize the sensitivity by which co-regulation of co-expressed genes can be detected.
3485
3722
In a screen that covered ~40 per cent of all protein-coding genes according to the latest Ensembl annotation, we identified 21 co-expressed gene clusters with 66 cases of statistically supported sharing of cis-regulatory sequence motifs.
3723
3893
The predictive value of the assignment of transcription factor binding sites was experimentally evaluated on EBF binding sites in a set of B-cell expressed gene clusters.
3894
4041
The predicted cases of co-regulation include several previously known prototype examples of tissue specific regulation, but also novel predictions.
4042
4188
All data are made available to the research community in the form of an internet resource that may serve as a starting point for further analysis.

Results
4200
4340
The analysis was based on the assumption that homologous genes in mouse and human are equivalent in most aspects of regulation and function.
4341
4438
In particular, we assumed that the transcriptional regulation is conserved for orthologous genes.
4439
4584
For example, the mouse gene Myh1 and the human gene MYH1 are assumed to share expression pattern and to share important cis-regulatory sequences.
4585
4752
Below, the term 'ortholog pair' will be applied as a two-species equivalent of 'gene', for which expression and sequence data where retrieved for both mouse and human.
4753
4822
Ensembl gene annotations [19,20] were applied thoughout the analysis.
4825
5073
Previous results by our group and others have shown that statistical analysis of gene expression profiles in a large compendium of expression data can predict targets of differentiation processes, and identify functionally coupled genes [12,21,22].
5074
5219
In the following analysis, we specifically focused on a compendium derived from the recently completed Novartis expression atlas (SymAtlas) [23].
5220
5424
These data contain transcription profiles for 140 mouse and human tissues generated by hybridization on customized Affymetrix chips, and cover a large fraction of the mouse and human protein-coding genes.
5425
5581
Sequence annotation of the Novartis probes linked the mouse and human data to approximately 17.000 unique Ensembl gene identities in each species (Table 1).
5582
5727
Between the two datasets, 13282 non-redundant ortholog pairs could be identified by linkage of reciprocal Ensembl homology assignments (Table 1).
5728
5879
In later steps, we excluded genes for which regulatory sequence could not be extracted (Methods), leaving 9561 ortholog pairs for clustering (Table 1).
5880
5959
The final dataset included ~40% of the mouse and human Ensembl annotated genes.
5962
6090
We clustered the mouse/human ortholog pairs based on their expression profiles across the 140 mouse and human tissues (Methods).
6091
6213
We computed clusters at cut-off levels ranging from Pearson's correlation coefficient (hereafter termed PCC) 0.61 to 0.99.
6214
6309
At the lowest applied cut-off, 57% of all ortholog pairs in the data were members of a cluster.
6310
6424
The cluster sizes were distributed in a skewed manner, with a predominant formation of small clusters (Figure 1A).
6425
6542
All analyses hereafter were performed at a PCC = 0.75 cut-off, which generated 160 clusters with 2407 ortholog pairs.
6543
6647
This relatively stringent cut-off was chosen to reduce the number of non-relevant genes in the clusters.
6648
6879
A higher cut-off did not seem reasonable given the noise-level of the microarray experiments (as judged by the Pearson correlation between replicated samples and between probes that are annotated for the same gene, data not shown).
6882
6969
According to the definition, a gene battery should encode functionally linked proteins.
6970
7144
We used Gene Ontology (GO) terms, protein-protein interactions (from the BIND database [24]), and manual curation to assess functional linkage within our expression clusters.
7145
7360
First, we investigated the relationship between expression profile similarity of two ortholog pairs and their relative probability to share a functional annotation term or to encode interacting proteins (Figure 1B).
7361
7526
There was a consistent correlation between co-expression and the relative probability for two genes to share a GO-term or to encode interacting proteins (Figure 1B).
7529
7651
Second, we studied the statistical over-representation of GO terms and interacting proteins inside the clusters (Methods).
7652
7747
30/32 clusters with ten or more ortholog pairs contained at least one over-represented GO term.
7748
7884
The proportion of small clusters with over-represented GO terms was lower, which reflects a lack of statistical power in small clusters.
7885
7969
Genes encoding interacting protein pairs were also over-represented inside clusters.
7970
8059
35 cases of protein-protein interaction between two genes in the same cluster were found.
8060
8183
In contrast, 1000 simulations on permuted data revealed a median of 9 interactions (observations ranging between 5 and 21).
8184
8326
The BIND data contained only 600 interactions that could be mapped to the dataset, which explains the seemingly low number of 35 interactions.
8329
8385
Finally, the clusters were annotated by manual curation.
8386
8499
Six examples are shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and clusters with predicted regulators are listed in Table 2.
8500
8545
For a full overview, see the web supplement .
8546
8847
Several clusters clearly represent gene sets that mediate specialized features of different cell types, including smooth muscle specific genes (cluster 40, Figure 2), B lymphocyte-specific genes (cluster 16, Figure 3), and genes selectively expressed in the testis (cluster 5, part shown in Figure 4).
8848
9100
Further, we detected clusters that were related to cellular processes or organelles, including endoplasmatic reticulum (cluster 13, Figure 5), protein synthesis (cluster 1, Figure 6), and modulators of transcriptional regulation (cluster 65, Figure 7).
9101
9199
A grand majority of the clusters were defined by peaks at different amplitudes in several tissues.
9200
9358
As an example, the endoplasmatic reticulum cluster (Figure 5) was defined by a highly variant profile with strong expression in, for example, exocrine glands.
9359
9491
Generally, the cluster profiles were conserved between species, in the sense that clusters were defined by peaks in the same organs.
9492
9608
This effect was more pronounced for clusters with expression in a single organ, such as the testis (data not shown).
9611
9771
In combination, the GO term enrichment, the protein-protein interaction, and the manual curation convincingly show that clustered genes are functionally linked.
9774
9885
In the next part of the analysis, individual ortholog pairs were scored for transcription factor binding sites.
9886
9986
Binding motifs were represented in the form of Position Frequency Matrices (hereafter denoted PFMs).
9987
10219
Based on a fixed amount of upstream DNA sequence in each ortholog pair, a statistical score was computed to predict the potential for a site in the sequence to bind the factor corresponding to a PFM (described in detail in Methods).
10220
10366
We extracted upstream + intronic sequence from the Ensembl database, in amounts of 2, 6 or 15 kb per gene (see Methods for details on boundaries).
10367
10518
A filter was applied that removed ortholog pairs for which the transcription start differed between the two species (>1000 bp difference, see Methods).
10519
10586
Filtering was successful for 12239 unique ortholog pairs (Table 1).
10587
10720
In a subsequent filter, DNA sequence that was not conserved between mouse and human was removed, so-called phylogenetic footprinting.
10721
10844
Phylogenetic footprinting was applied at different stringency, to allow the following optimization of the protocol (below).
10845
10916
Furthermore, all exon sequence was removed from the analysis (Methods).
10917
11047
Finally, the sequences were matched with the expression data based on annotation, the overlap being 9561 ortholog pairs (Table 1).
11050
11133
322 vertebrate PFMs were downloaded from the TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases [25,26].
11134
11399
Since the databases appeared to contain redundant or equivalent entries, highly similar PFMs were grouped and merged using single linkage hierarchical clustering and a PFM distance measure defined in [27], which reduced the number of PFMs from 322 to 266 (Methods).
11400
11571
This step reduced the redundancy, but did not merge all identically annotated PFMs (see for example the redundant serum response factor (SRF) PFMs in Table 2, cluster 40).
11574
11789
After the retrieval and preprocessing of both sequences and PFMs, all individual sequences were tested for PFM matches using the MAST software [28], a software for identifying single or multiple motifs in sequences.
11790
11879
MAST was set to compute one p-value for each PFM with respect to each sequence (Methods).
11880
12058
Based on the p-values obtained from the MAST software, a composite score was defined as the product of the p-value in the mouse and human sequences of an ortholog pair (Methods).
12059
12245
A composite score close to 0 indicates that both the mouse and human promoter sequence in the ortholog pair contains sequence elements that are in very good agreement with a certain PFM.
12248
12455
To address the biological validity of the MAST composite scores within the context of a set of co-expressed genes, we screened 48 ortholog pairs present in B-cell expressed clusters for individual EBF sites.
12456
12573
In all, 24 individual EBF sites in 15 different ortholog pairs were detected (supplementary data, additional file 1).
12574
12817
To test the functionality (in terms of EBF binding) of these sites, we examined the potential of 22 basepair duplex oligo-nucleotides spanning the presumed sites to compete for protein binding in Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA:s).
12818
13040
EBF binding capacity was assayed using nuclear extracts from the pre-B cell line 40-EI, a labelled mouse mb-1 promoter high affinity EBF site [29], and competitor oligo-nucleotides covering the new potential binding sites.
13041
13270
In the absence of competitor oligo-nucleotide, a prominent DNA/protein complex (mb-1/EBF) could be detected whereas this complex was undetectable after the addition of a 300 fold molar excess of the unlabeled binding site (mb-1).
13271
13485
The identity of the protein and the specificity of the binding were verified by competition with a point mutated mb-1/EBF site and by the inclusion of an EBF specific antibody into the reaction mixture (Figure 8B).
13486
13871
The point mutated EBF binding site was unable to abolish complex formation even in a 1000-fold molar excess (Figure 8B), indicating that we detect specific protein DNA interactions with this experimental set up. 18 out of the 24 new binding sites competed for complex formation when added in a 300- or 1000-fold molar excess, and thus have the ability to bind EBF in vitro (Figure 8A).
13872
14054
We conclude that the large majority of binding sites were able to functionally interact with the predicted protein, and that the composite score in principle detected factor binding.
14055
14257
It should however be emphasized that the quality of predictions is dependent on the quality of the binding site descriptions, and the result does not necessarily imply that other predicted factors bind.
14260
14494
To test whether the identified clusters represent potential gene batteries, i.e. contain shared cis-regulatory elements, we designed a procedure to detect significant over-representation of orthologs that match a PFM inside a cluster.
14495
14669
The procedure is based on a modification of Fisher's exact test, which tests for dependency between two events (in this case cluster membership vs detection of a motif) [30].
14670
14759
We introduced a procedure to optimize the composite score thresholds for individual PFMs.
14760
14856
In brief, we selected the threshold that gave the lowest Fisher test p-value in any one cluster.
14857
15006
This was based on the assumption that non-random distribution of detections over clusters reflects biological function, as has been proposed in [31].
15007
15092
The Fisher test p-values with the optimized thresholds are hereafter termed p-scores.
15095
15215
The tests of multiple detection thresholds, multiple clusters and 266 PFMs led to a need to compensate for mass testing.
15216
15312
This was done by estimating false discovery rates (FDR) based on simulations on randomized data.
15313
15480
In brief, we compared the outcome when using permuted and when using observed data at different p-scores, and defined the FDR as the ratio between the two (Figure 9A).
15481
15599
This procedure allowed us to choose a significance threshold with a controlled expected number of spurious detections.
15600
15636
Simulations were repeated 100 times.
15637
15776
Since optimization of detection thresholds were repeated in each simulation round, no bias in disfavour of the control case was introduced.
15779
16060
Using the described algorithm, we analyzed the number of times a motif was over-represented when using different amounts of DNA sequence per gene (2, 6 or 15 kb) and different stringency in the phylogenetic footprinting (>0% (keep all sequence), >60%, >70%, >80% or >90% identity).
16061
16182
The analysis was performed at 10% false discovery rate and with the clustering obtained at PCC = 0.75 clustering cut-off.
16183
16356
At all DNA amounts, higher stringency phylogenetic footprinting appeared to be beneficial, and between DNA amounts, 2 kb and 4 kb compared favourably over 15 kb (Figure 9C).
16357
16469
We conclude that optimal results are obtained when using a limited amount of sequence per gene (see Discussion).
16472
16632
A potential confounding factor in the analysis is that similarity in upstream sequence may be attributable to factors other than shared cis-regulatory elements.
16633
16832
The most important such factor is likely to be gene paralogy, since over-represented motifs might simply represent matches to non-functional (not yet diverged) sequence in a co-expressed gene family.
16833
16940
In total, 22343 cases of pairwise paralogy were detected in the dataset of 9561 ortholog pairs using BLAST.
16941
17044
All genes with transcripts matches at a BLAST E-value less than 1.0 were defined as potential paralogs.
17045
17136
Of the 2407 ortholog pairs that clustered, 219 genes had a paralog inside the same cluster.
17137
17364
This was clearly an over-representation since filling clusters with random genes from the dataset produced an average of 122 genes with a paralog inside a cluster (values between 104 to 131 observed in 10 randomization rounds).
17365
17605
In a side-by-side comparison, we therefore analyzed the effect of removing paralogs from a cluster before testing for over-represented motifs (see Methods), as opposed to not removing paralogs but the same number of randomly selected genes.
17606
17733
The results showed no increase in the number of over-represented motifs when allowing paralogs in the same cluster (Figure 9B).
17736
17910
The final analysis was performed with 2 kb sequence and 80% phylogenetic footprinting (results generated with variations of these parameters are found in the web supplement).
17911
17981
Again, the clustering generated at PCC = 0.75 was chosen for analysis.
17982
18110
The over-representation algorithm was run in the above cases, using 100 simulations to estimate false discovery rate thresholds.
18111
18183
Over-represented motifs with FDR:s less than 2.5% and 10% were recorded.
18184
18302
Key features of these results are presented in Tables 2 and 3, and the complete results are available by web browser .
18305
18460
A predictive screen performed with these settings associated 66 motifs to co-expression in a total of 21 clusters at FDR thresholds 2.5% and 10% (Table 2).
18461
18595
There was a clear tendency for motifs to be detected in most large clusters, and for smaller clusters to lack over-represented motifs.
18596
18785
This can be directly explained by the fact that even a high degree of motif presence in a small cluster can be attributed to spurious detections, and that the Fisher test accounts for that.
18786
19138
The over-represented motifs were validated against the literature, and fell into three main categories: 1) previously described cases of gene-battery-like regulation, 2)previously unreported cases of gene battery-like regulation with some support in a limited number of genes, and 3) hypothetical cases of gene battery regulation (Table 3, Discussion).
19141
19244
In the typical case, an over-represented motif did not cover all cluster members but rather a fraction.
19245
19317
The average coverage was 15%, with observations ranging from 1% to 100%.
19318
19595
The limited coverage can be exemplified by the relatively large (104 ortholog pairs) cluster of liver-selective genes, which contained 8 over-represented motifs at FDR<10%, where the PFM annotation implied HNF1, HNF4, ARP1, PPAR-γ, and COUP-TF as the binding factors (Table 2).
19596
19716
These different motifs were detected in between 8 and 19 ortholog pairs, indicating a cluster coverage of less than 20%.
19717
19920
An example of very high coverage was observed in the cluster that contained smooth muscle differentiation markers, in which 6/7 (86%) ortholog pairs were positive for a Serum Response Factor (SRF) motif.
19921
20040
We compared our results for HNF-1 to a whole-genome experimental screen for targets of this factor in hepatocytes [32].
20041
20197
28% (29/104) of the ortholog pairs inside the liver cluster contained experimentally verified HNF-1 sites, which indicates a high but not complete coverage.
20198
20404
Cross-comparison of experimentally and computationally identified HNF-1 targets showed a 69% – 71% agreement (results for the two different HNF-1 PFMs at 2 kb/gene masked for 90% phylogenetic conservation).
20407
20603
As a complement to using database motifs, we applied de novo motif elicitation to screen the regulatory sequence of each cluster for over-represented DNA motifs that were not present in databases.
20604
20682
A two-step procedure based on the MEME algorithm [33] was developed (Methods).
20683
20777
The use of a cluster to define a PFM will lead to a bias when testing for over-representation.
20778
20892
A simulation that involved motif elicitation from randomized clusters was used to account for this bias (Methods).
20893
21022
28 de novo motifs were identified as over-represented in relation to the null simulation (Supplementary data, additional file 1).
21023
21177
Of these 28 motifs, 13 matched a described database motif (based on the PFM similarity score described in Methods and in footnote of supplementary table).
21178
21267
9/13 of the matching motifs corresponded to motifs that were over-represented in Table 3.
21268
21332
The remaining 15 motifs may represent novel regulatory elements.
21333
21430
These motifs, and a description of the procedure, are available in the supplementary information.
21433
21443
Discussion
21445
21674
The gene battery theory predicts that the core features of differentiated cells are encoded by gene batteries, i.e. groups of functionally coupled, co-expressed genes that are regulated by similar sets of cis-regulatory elements.
21675
21823
The primary aim of this article was to survey the mouse and human genomes for cases that fall within or close to the idealized gene battery concept.
21826
21980
Hierarchical clustering of an extensive compendium of micro-array expression data in mouse and human identified large numbers of co-expressed gene groups.
21981
22156
A grand majority of the larger clusters were significantly enriched for genes that shared one or several GO-terms, indicating that co-expressed genes are functionally coupled.
22157
22298
Moreover, interactions were significantly more common between proteins that are encoded by clustered pairs compared to randomly chosen pairs.
22299
22405
21 clusters, finally, were significantly enriched for genes that shared potential cis-regulatory elements 
22407
22735
The predicted over represented motifs (Table 2) fell into three principal categories: (i) predictions in agreement with described gene batteries, (ii) predictions supported by a limited number of observations, where the analysis predicted gene battery-like regulation, and (iii) novel predictions of hypothetical gene batteries.
22736
22808
The findings are summarized with respect to these categories in Table 3.
22811
22888
For type (i) predictions the method is useful for proposing new target genes.
22889
23020
As an example, the smooth muscle cluster contains 4 validated serum response factor (SRF) targets (Acta2, Actg2, Myl11, Tagln) [5].
23021
23141
The method identifies two more genes in this cluster, Myl9 and Lpp as potential SRF targets in smooth muscle (Figure 2).
23142
23325
The findings in two clusters that are relevant for lymphocytes (cluster 4 in the web supplement) and B-lymphocytes (cluster 16, Figure 3) are further examples of type (i) predictions.
23326
23404
Cluster 4 contains genes that are expressed by various lymphocyte populations.
23405
23471
Significantly enriched motifs were Irf1/Irf2, NF-kappaB, and ISRE.
23472
23520
Irf1 and Ir2 appear to bind the same sites [34].
23521
23580
Irf1 knockout mice are impaired in their myelopoiesis [35].
23581
23658
NFkappaB is a well-known regulator of inflammation and immune functions [36].
23659
23734
Cluster 16 contains genes that are specifically expressed in B-lymphocytes.
23735
23816
SpiB was identified as the most over-represented PFM followed by AREB6 and Oct-1.
23817
23909
Knockout of SpiB caused specific defects in B-cell terminally differentiated functions [37].
23910
23966
AREB6 is a hematopoietic transcriptional repressor [38].
23967
24114
Whereas Oct-1 seems to be dispensable for B-cell development [39], it regulates B lymphocyte genes in combination with specific co-activators [40].
24117
24257
In type (ii) cases, a regulator with some degree of documentation is statistically supported to play a role in gene battery-like regulation.
24258
24430
As an example, RFX family proteins have been shown to regulate a limited number of genes in spermatogenesis, and SOX17 has been shown to be expressed in the testis [41-43].
24431
24553
Here, we demonstrate that motifs corresponding to these factors are present in 8–11% of testis-selective genes (Figure 4).
24554
24690
29% of kidney-specific genes were covered by HNF-1 and HNF-4 sites, suggesting that these genes may be general regulators in the kidney.
24693
24815
Finally, type (iii) cases represent novel predictions which can be viewed as testable hypotheses of regulatory mechanisms.
24816

A complete list of PFMs in the different categories with references to the literature is presented in Table 3. Examples include a potential functional role for an Ikaros-like motif in retina-selective genes (cluster 44 in the web supplementary), and a Pax family factor acting on extracellular matrix genes with strong expression in arteries (cluster 8 in the web supplementary).
25196
25375
Interestingly, a combination of Ets family factor motifs, Nuclear respiratory factor motifs, and E2F motifs was detected in several clusters of a housekeeping character (Table 3).
25378
25561
The gene battery concept predicts that upstream transcription factors coordinate the expression of target genes through binding to similar cis-regulatory elements in the target genes.
25562
25804
In a recent report, Alloco and co-workers [44] studied the relationship between co-expression in yeast (as determined by correlation in a set of 610 arrays) and the probability of sharing a transcription factor (as determined by experiments).
25805
25931
In their experiments, an expression profile correlation of 0.85 implied a probability of transcription factor sharing of >0.5.
25932
26077
The incomplete coverage in our analysis may similarly indicate that other mechanisms than co-regulation contribute to the coordinated expression.
26078
26202
Importantly, it is technically difficult to accurately quantify the fraction of genes in a cluster that respond to a factor.
26203
26276
The presence of false positive gene cluster members reduces the coverage.
26277
26360
Uncertainty in the motif assignment to ortholog pairs may also reduce the coverage.
26361
26535
In one case study, we could use data from an independent experimental screen to confirm that the liver-selective cluster had a limited coverage of HNF-1 responders (results).
26536
26684
Further experiments are required to resolve to what extent the lack of coverage reflects alternative regulatory mechanisms or technical limitations.
26687
26790
The tissues in the dataset represent samples of limited morphological resolution at a fixed time point.
26791
27005
As a consequence, co-expressed gene groups that are active under specific developmental phases, under specific environmental stresses, or in small and localized anatomical structures are likely to escape detection.
27006
27109
Moreover, co-expressed gene groups with a peak in one tissue only are unresolved for single cell types.
27110
27217
Low coverage of motifs in such clusters may reflect contaminating genes that derive from another cell type.
27220
27405
The Affymetrix technology that were used to generate the expression measurements has been validated and match results obtained with tag sampling for sufficiently abundant genes [45,46].
27406
27529
Low intensity signals did not correlate well, indicating that such genes are less likely to form clusters (data not shown).
27530
27632
Cross hybridization between related genes may, in theory, contribute to correlating expression levels.
27633
28032
We can exclude that clusters primarily form as a result of cross-hybridization, since (1) members of well-characterized gene families appear in different (the expected) clusters (eg smooth muscle and cardiac actins) and since (2) co-expressed genes tended to share GO terms or to encode interacting proteins to a higher degree than they tended to be paralogs (supplementary data, additional file 1).
28033
28173
We cannot however exclude subtle effects related to cross-hybridization, since results with cDNA microarrays indicate this possibility [47].
28176
28302
Transcription factors in the same family often have similar DNA binding properties and bind to the same sites on target genes.
28303
28371
This leads to an ambiguity in the interpretation of PFM annotations.
28372
28487
The MEF2 motif, is for example a receptor for the mammalian MEF2A, MEF2B, MEFC and MEFD transcription factors [48].
28488
28686
Similarly, the E2F motif is a receptor for a family of 9 E2F family proteins that form heterodimers with another family of proteins, the DP proteins, in a way that affects the binding affinity [49].
28687
28797
Different E2F proteins act at different stages in the cell cycle [50], and this is not captured by our method.
28800
28908
One additional data limitation is that a fraction of Ensembl transcripts may lack sequence in their 5' ends.
28909
29023
The accuracy of our transcription starts is therefore dependent on the quality of the Ensembl transcript database.
29026
29101
Our approach is technically related to the Toucan and ConFac tools [17,51].
29102
29319
Important differences and extensions are the introduction of a composite scoring system, a procedure to optimize PFM thresholds, and the use of simulation at the level of the whole clustering to measure significances.
29322
29535
The performance of the method was not affected by the removal of paralogous genes from the clusters (Figure 9B), and clustering of such genes is clearly not a significant source of false positive motif prediction.
29536
29707
Consequently, we decided to include the paralogs in the final analysis since we believe that co-expression of such genes may be a result of shared cis-regulatory elements.
29710
29790
We further evaluated the effects of using different DNA amounts in the analysis.
29791
30011
In principal, it is motivated to include a substantial amount of DNA sequence per gene, since mammalian enhancers are frequently located far upstream in relation to the transcription start, or downstream in intronic DNA.
30012
30184
However, the benefits of including as much sequence as possible must be balanced against the risk of introducing vast amounts of non-informative sequence into the analysis.
30185
30305
The evaluation clearly favoured using limited amounts of DNA, and high stringency phylogenetic footprinting (Figure 9C).
30306
30510
The optimal future alternative may be to assemble a small amount of DNA from a large area of the genome using algorithms that sort out regulatory DNA regions more efficient than phylogenetic footprinting.
30513
30622
The approach presented here needs to be extended to generate more complete models of gene battery regulation.
30623
30754
Modelling of cis-regulatory element combinations and the relative position and spacing of elements are examples of such extensions.
30755
30965
The use of PCC as a measure of co-expression may need to be reconsidered if extending the approach to very large datasets, since this measure may be sensitive to noninformative signals in a majority of samples.
30966
31100
Further, the expression levels of potential trans-regulators and co-factors (based on protein interaction networks) can be introduced.
31101
31210
Most likely, the method will benefit from a more accurate identification of regulatory regions (Crawford-04) 
31212
31222
Conclusion
31224
31329
We screened the mouse and human genomes and transcriptomes for instances of gene battery-like regulation.
31330
31492
Comparative clustering was highly predictive of gene function and protein interaction, which indicates that potential gene batteries could be identified this way.
31493
31744
Based on a statistical composite score for motifs in ortholog pairs, and a simulation approach to determine significance levels, we found 21 instances of statistically supported gene battery-like regulation that were conserved between mouse and human.
31745
31863
These included known cases of gene battery regulation in tissues such as muscle, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and liver.
31864
32004
A second category of predictions included regulators with some degree of documentation, e.g. in testis, kidney, and endoplasmatic reticulum.
32005
32105
Finally, new candidate gene batteries with statistically enriched cis-regulatory motifs were listed.
32108
32272
The results of this investigation emphasizes the need to study differentiation in terms of larger transcriptional units, and extends the methodology for doing this.
32275
32282
Methods
32284
32470
Target sequences for the Novartis Gene Atlas V2 mouse and human expression datasets [23] were matched against the Ensembl [20] collection of mouse and human transcripts using BLAST [52].
32471
32574
In cases where the E-value exceeded 10-20, the BLAST search was re-done against Ensembl gene sequences.
32575
32659
If there was no match below 10-20, the probe set was excluded from further analysis.
32660
32750
The resulting datasets covered 17552 mouse and 16929 human unique Ensembl genes (Table 1).
32751
32826
Mouse/human orthologous gene pairs were formed using Ensembl homology maps.
32827
33020
Redundant occurrences of the same gene in more than one ortholog pair were avoided according to the following procedure: the Ensembl human orthologs for each Ensembl mouse gene were identified.
33021
33156
When more than one ortholog was assigned to a mouse gene, the one with the lowest positional disagreement d (defined below) was chosen.
33157
33212
The procedure was repeated for all Ensembl human genes.
33213
33314
Reciprocally matching ortholog pairs were identified, and others were excluded from further analysis.
33315
33569
The mouse and human expression profiles of each ortholog pair were normalized with respect to mean and standard deviation and combined into a single larger profile, finally yielding an expression dataset with 13282 non-redundant ortholog pairs (Table 1).
33572
33669
For each ortholog pair, mouse and human candidate regulatory sequence was extracted from Ensembl.
33670
33917
The sequence extraction algorithm starts with an ortholog pair, localizes the 5' end of the transcript in the genome in each species, and computes a value that measures the positional disagreement between the transcript 5' ends in the two species.
33918
34000
If the disagreement is too large, the ortholog pair is excluded from the analysis.
34001
34096
Of the 12239 ortholog pairs in the expression dataset, 9561 satisfied this criterion (Table 1).
34097
34191
A full description of the sequence extraction procedure is available in the online supplement.
34194
34262
Three different lengths of DNA were extracted: 2 kb, 6 kb and 15 kb.
34263
34482
The 2 kb dataset contained nucleotide positions ranging from -2000 to -1 relative to the transcription start, the 6 kb dataset contained positions -4000 to +2000 and the 15 k dataset contained positions -10000 to +5000.
34485
34594
The sequence datasets were subjected to phylogenetic footprinting, i.e. removal of poorly conserved sequence.
34595
34714
The mouse and human sequences of each ortholog pair were aligned by use of the LAGAN software [53] (standard settings).
34715
34795
Similarity was defined as the number of identical nucleotides in a 20 bp window.
34796
34868
Nucleotides in windows with similarity below the threshold were removed.
34869
35004
In all, five different similarity threshold were applied: >0% (no footprinting – use all sequence), >60%, >70%, >80% and >90% identity.
35007
35128
Each candidate regulatory sequence was aligned to the corresponding transcripts (pairwise BLAST, e-value threshold 0.01).
35129
35192
Nucleotides aligning with one or more transcripts were removed.
35195
35473
The set of 9561 orthologs pairs, for which both regulatory sequence and expression data could be assembled, were clustered with respect to expression pattern using hierarchical clustering [54] with average group linkage and Pearson's correlation coefficient as distance measure.
35474
35583
In the average group linkage algorithm, cluster distances are defined as the distances between cluster means.
35584
35658
We defined the cluster mean as the arithmetic mean of all cluster members.
35659
35734
Correlation thresholds between 0.61 and 0.99 were applied in steps of 0.01.
35737
35859
Motifs represented as position frequency matrices (PFMs) were downloaded from the TRANSFAC [55] and JASPAR [25] databases.
35860
35902
Non-vertebrate matrices were filtered out.
35903
36041
Highly similar matrices were grouped and merged using single linkage hierarchical clustering, reducing the number of PFMs from 322 to 266.
36042
36119
Distances between matrices were calculated using a probabilistic method [56].
36120
36281
Individual positions between matrices were compared using the chi square test, and p-values for all overlapping positions were combined using the geometric mean.
36282
36381
Sense and antisense of motifs were compared for all possible frameshifts with at least 75% overlap.
36382
36497
Clustered motifs (score > 0.5) were added together in overlapping positions, and flanking positions were discarded.
36498
36617
PFMs were transformed into position weight matrices (PWM:s) to make them compatible with the MAST software (see below).
36618
36702
The value of each matrix element was calculated according to the following formula: 
36704
36941
where n is the raw count from the corresponding position in the PFM, N is the the number of observations (sum of each position/column in the PFM), and are pseudocounts and p(b) is the background frequency of the corresponding nucleotide.
36944
37071
For each ortholog pair, both mouse and human regulatory sequences were scored for all motif PWM's using the MAST software [57].
37072
37181
MAST was set to compute whole-sequence p-values (-seqp setting), using a first order Markov chain background.
37182
37318
The Markov chain background data where computed from unmasked genomic sequence -4000 upstream to +2000 downstream in all ortholog pairs.
37321
37434
The p-values reported by MAST for the mouse and human sequences of an ortholog pair were multiplied for each PWM.
37435
37589
The result was treated as a composite score that reflects the overall "signal" for a certain binding site in the regulatory sequences of an ortholog pair.
37590
37740
The composite score is a product of two p-values but should not be interpreted as a p-value, since the mouse and human sequences are highly dependent.
37743
37834
Clusters were evaluated for over-representation of GO terms using Fisher's exact test [30].
37835
37994
Due to the large number of tests (the number of clusters times the number of GO terms), the resulting p-values were corrected using the Bonferroni method [30].
37997
38084
The test was applied to the 9561 ortholog pairs with both sequence and expression data.
38085
38118
These constituted the population.
38119
38236
For each PWM, genes with MAST composite scores below a threshold were defined as labeled and the others as unlabeled.
38237
38306
Further, each cluster was considered as a sample from the population.
38307
38399
The algorithm is briefly sketched here and is available in detail in the online supplement: 
38401
38505
First, ortholog pairs were permuted across the dataset, making each cluster a random selection of genes.
38506
38574
Second, an optimal composite score threshold was found for each PWM.
38575
38800
This was done by computing the Fischer test p-value for over-representation of labeled ortholog pairs for all clusters k at a range of detection thresholds ranging from 10-8 to 10-3 in stepwise increases by a factor of 100.5.
38801
38902
The threshold chosen for each PWM was the one that gave the best p-value for that PWM in any cluster.
38903
39021
P-values for over-representation of all motifs in all clusters were finally calculated using the optimized thresholds.
39022
39064
We refer to this statistic as the p-score.
39065
39259
This whole procedure was repeated for 100 iterations, which resulted in empirical estimates of how many over-represented motifs we could expect below a certain p-score under the null hypothesis.
39262
39337
This step was identical to step 1 but without permutations and repetitions.
39340
39547
After the simulation, we defined the false discovery rate (FDR) at p-score p as the expected number of over-represented motifs in the null simulation, divided by the corresponding value in the observed data.
39550
39729
40-EI and 230–238 cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM pyruvate, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol and 50 μg gentamicin per ml (complete RPMI media).
39730
39876
STAT activation in 230–238 cells was achieved by 5 hours of incubation with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant mouse interferon gamma (Immunokontact, Germany).
39877
39943
Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al. [58].
39944
40171
DNA probes were labelled with γ[32P] ATP (Amersham Biosciences, UK) by incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and purified on a mini Quick Spin Oligo Column (Roche Diagnostics, Sweden).
40172
40445
Nuclear extracts were incubated with labelled probe (20,000 cpm, 3 fmol) for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 70 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 4% Glycerol) with 0.75 μg Poly(dI/dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK).
40446
40524
When EBF-binding was investigated, 1 mM ZnCl2 was supplemented to the mixture.
40525
40633
The samples were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel, which was dried and subjected to autoradiography.
40634
40822
In the supershift experiments (Figure 8B), DNA competitors or antibodies (anti-EBF SC-15333, anti-Actin SC-1616, Santa Cruz Biotech) were added 10 min before the addition of the DNA probe.
40823
40904
To visualize the super-shifted complex, the unbound probe was run out of the gel.
40905
41155
The following Oligonucleotides were used for EMSA: mb-1 sense: 5'-AGCCACCTCTCAGGGGAATTGTGG-3'; mb-1 antisense: 5'-CCACAATTCCCCTGAGAGGTGGCT-3'; mutated mb-1sense: 5'-AGCCACCTCTCAGCCGTTTTGTGG-3'; mutated mb-1 antisense: 5'-CCACAAAACGGCTGAGAGGTGGCT-3';

42254
We identified all gene pairs that correlated above or below a threshold T (X-axis).
42255
42457
We measured the fraction of such pairs for which there was (i) a BIND database protein-protein interaction recorded in human, (ii) at least one shared gene ontology term, and (iii) evidence of paralogy.
42458
42827
We then computed the relative probability for genes above T with this feature, compared to gene pairs below T. At expression correlation 0.80, co-expression was associated with a 100-fold relative probability for genes to encode protein interactors, a 10-fold probability for genes to share functional annotation, but only a 3-fold probability for genes to be paralogs.
