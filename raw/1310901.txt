Down-regulation of interferon regulatory factor 4 gene expression in leukemic cells due to hypermethylation of CpG motifs in the promoter region

Abstract
156
464
Although the bcr-abl translocation has been shown to be the causative genetic aberration in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), there is mounting evidence that the deregulation of other genes, such as the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF-4), is also implicated in the pathogenesis of CML.
465
633
Promoter methylation of CpG target sites or direct deletions/insertions of genes are mechanisms of a reversible or permanent silencing of gene expression, respectively.
634
780
Therefore, we investigated whether IRF-4 promoter methylation or mutation may be involved in the regulation of IRF-4 expression in leukemia cells.
781
1013
Whereas promoter mutations or structural rearrangements could be excluded as a cause of altered IRF-4 expression in hematopoietic cells, the IRF-4 promoter methylation status was found to significantly influence IRF-4 transcription.
1014
1235
First, treatment of IRF-4-negative lymphoid, myeloid and monocytic cell lines with the methylation-inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent increase of IRF-4 mRNA and protein levels.
1236
1397
Second, using a restriction-PCR-assay and bisulfite-sequencing we identified specifically methylated CpG sites in IRF-4-negative but not in IRF-4-positive cells.
1398
1650
Third, we clearly determined promoter methylation as a mechanism for IRF-4 down-regulation via reporter gene assays, but did not detect an association of methylational status and mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases or methyl-CpG-binding proteins.
1651
1796
Together, these data suggest CpG site-specific IRF-4 promoter methylation as a putative mechanism of down-regulated IRF-4 expression in leukemia.

INTRODUCTION
1812
2083
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder with a typical three phased course (chronic, accelerated and blastic phase) reflecting the loss of differentiation and malignant progress which inevitably leads to death after the blastic phase (1,2).
2084
2263
The hallmark genetic aberration of CML is a reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(9;22) leading to expression of a bcr-abl fusion gene, an aberrant activated tyrosine kinase (2).
2264
2420
Treatment with interferon α (IFN-α) prolongs survival of CML patients and is associated with a complete cytogenetic response in 5–33% of CML patients (1,2).
2421
2575
Recently, we described an impaired expression of the interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF-4) in CML, correlating with poor response to IFN-α treatment (3).
2576
2635
The cause of the silencing of IRF-4 level remained unclear.
2638
2783
Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are a family of transcriptional regulators defined by a characteristic homology in their DNA-binding domain.
2784
2940
They play an important role in the regulation of various genes (such as IFNs, interleukins, MHC class I/II), apoptosis and differentiation/maturation (4–6).
2941
3096
IRF-4 (ICSAT/Pip/MUM1/LSIRF) is one member with very restricted expression pattern: Predominately B- and activated T-lymphocytes are IRF-4 positive (7–11).
3097
3275
In contrast to other IRFs, expression of IRF-4 cannot be induced by IFNs, but by antigen stimulation, crosslinking of T- or B-cell receptors or phorbol-myristate-acetate (10,11).
3276
3535
Consistent with the restriction of expression to immunocompetent cells, mice with deletion of IRF-4 failed to develop mature and functionally active B- and T-lymphocytes (12), and the impaired expression of IRF-4 in CML was predominately found in T-cells (3).
3536
3612
These data suggest a crucial role for IRF-4 in the function of immune cells.
3615
3851
Methylation of dinucleotide cytosine-guanosine motifs (CpG), especially in CpG islands located in promoter regions, is one of the mechanisms of gene regulation in mammals and a common event of gene silencing in human neoplasias (13,14).
3852
3969
As opposed to normal cells, hypermethylation of CpG islands is a frequently observed phenomenon in every cancer type.
3970
4133
De novo DNA methylation of genes such as cell cycle, DNA repair, apoptosis and tumor suppressor genes is therefore thought to be involved in tumorigenesis (15–17).
4134
4244
Examples for such aberrated genes are MGMT, DAPK, p14ARF, p15INK4b, p16INK4a, BRCA1, CDH13 and APAF-1 (17–19).
4245
4455
In CML, methylation is known to regulate expression of the c-abl, the bcr gene and others (20–23), and the extent of methylation in the c-abl promoter has been shown to be associated with advanced disease (24).
4456
4603
Hypermethylation due to overexpression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) remains one possible explanation for de novo methylation in tumorigenesis.
4604
4690
Recently, DNMTs have been shown to be up-regulated in hematopoietic malignancies (25).
4691
4902
Methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MBPs) are thought to inhibit the binding of transcriptional factors to the promoter and are therefore discussed as one mechanism of transcription inhibition by hypermethylation (26).
4905
4994
In this work, we studied mechanisms of IRF-4 gene expression silencing in leukemic cells.
4995
5134
We analyzed the IRF-4 promoter region for genetic aberrations and methylational status in IRF-4-positive and -negative hematopoietic cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
5160
5416
K-562, Jurkat and U-937 were obtained from the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, USA) and EM-2, LAMA-84, CML-T1, BV-173, SD-1 and RPMI-8226 from the DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany).
5417
5488
All cell lines, except BV-173, SD-1 and RPMI-8226, were IRF-4-negative.
5491
5709
All cell lines were maintained at 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium with 1% glutamine (Gibco/BRL Eggenstein, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco/BRL), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany).
5710
5861
When indicated, cells were treated with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (AzadC) or 5-azacytidine (AzaC) (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) for different time periods.
5862
5940
Owing to their chemical instability fresh substances were re-added every 24 h.
5943
6209
For analysis of the IRF-4 promoter region for permanent aberrations such as insertions/deletions or mutation, we PCR-amplified two fragments from genomic DNA, which was extracted from depicted cell lines with a commercial kit (Qiagen, Hilde, Germany) as recommended.
6210
6392
The primers were 1-forward: 5′-TTGAGATGGAGTCTTGCTCTGT-3′, 1-reverse: 5′-CCAGGACCTCAGGAGGCCAGTCA-3′; 2-forward: 5′-AGCGGTGAAACTGAGAGTGCGAGGT-3′, 2-reverse: 5′-GCCACATCGCTGCAGTTTAG-3′.
6393
6490
The products were cloned with the ‘TOPO TA cloning kit’ (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands).
6491
6745
After bacterial amplification of the cloned PCR fragments by standard procedures, at least three clones from each sample were sequenced with an automated sequencer (ABI Prism 377, Applied Bio-systems, Foster City, USA) as recommended by the manufacturer.
6748
6882
To analyze the IRF-4 transcriptional level, RNA was extracted from cells using the commercial RNAzol-kit (Paesel, Frankfurt, Germany).
6883
6969
An aliquot of 1 μg total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis as described previously (27).
6970
7107
RNA expression analysis for IRF-4 and the reference gene β-actin was carried out by semi-quantitative PCR as described previously (3,27).
7108
7159
PCR products were verified by automated sequencing.
7160
7306
PCR primers and conditions for expression analysis of DNMT or MBP (DNMT1 DNMT3A, DNMT3B, MeCP, MBD1, MBD2 and MBD4) were published elsewhere (28).
7309
7426
For analysis of IRF-4 protein expression, a standard immunoblotting assay was performed as described previously (29).
7427
7717
Briefly, protein lysates were generated by incubating 1 × 106 cells in 100 µl RIPA buffer (1% NP-40, 0.5% sodiumdesoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µl/ml protease-inhibitory-mix, 1 µmol/ml sodiumorthovanadate in phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min on ice.
7718
7848
After centrifugation, protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by BCA-method (Pierce, Rockford, IL) as recommended.
7849
8009
Protein lysates (70–100 µg) were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a PVDF-membrane (Immobilon P, 0.45 µm; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany).
8010
8387
Membranes were blocked with 2.5% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) in TBST buffer (4.44 g/l Tris–HCL, 2.65 g/l TrisOH, 8.07 g/l NaCl, 0.2 g/l KCl and 500 µl/l Tween-20 in H2O) and subsequently incubated with primary antibody as indicated and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, anti-mouse or anti-goat IgG (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany), respectively.
8388
8496
The membranes were then developed with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany).
8497
8636
The primary antibodies were goat anti-IRF-4/ICSAT (M-17) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and mouse anti-β-actin (AC-74) (Sigma).
8639
8703
DNA was extracted with a commercial kit (Qiagen) as recommended.
8704
8947
Since the restriction ability of several endonucleases is inhibited by methylation of their target sequence, we used methylation-sensitive enzymes HpaII and HaeII-isochizomer Bsp143II and Bsh1236I (MBI Fermentas, St Leon-Rot, Germany) (20,24).
8948
9077
As control the methylation-resistant enzyme MspI and an enzyme with no recognition site in the target promoter, EcoRI, were used.
9078
9201
DNA (0.8 µg) was digested by 40 U the respective enzyme for 6 h and, to ensure complete cleavage, additional 20 U for 16 h.
9202
9370
Thereafter 100 ng of digested DNA was used to a PCR amplification of two fragments (F1 and F2) spanning part of the IRF-4 promoter (30) (GenBank U52683; see Figure 3A).
9371
9594
The sequences of the primers were F1-forward: 5′-TTGAGATGGAGTCTTGCTCTGT-3′, F1-reverse: ATCACTTCCAGACTTCAGTTCACCT-3′ (341 bp); F2-forward: 5′-AAGGTGAACTGAAGTCTGGAAGTGA-3′, F2-reverse: 5′-CCAGGACCTCAGGAGGCCAGTCA-3′ (474 bp).
9595
9643
The PCR conditions were described elsewhere (3).
9644
9714
PCR was performed with an annealing temperature of 62°C and 35 cycles.
9715
9915
When DNA was methylated at specific sites, the sensitive enzymes were not able to digest the DNA and amplification took place; in case of no methylation, DNA was digested and no product was generated.
9916
10027
The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 3% agarose gel, were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed.
10028
10079
PCR products were verified by automated sequencing.
10082
10119
DNA was extracted as described above.
10120
10299
Bisulfite treatment of DNA, leading to conversion of unmethylated cytosine to uracil residues and no change of methylated cytosine residues, was performed as described as follows.
10300
10468
Briefly, 1 µg of DNA and 2 µg of poly(dA–dT)(poly(dA–dT) copolymers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were denaturated for 20 min at 42°C in 0.3 M NaOH in a volume of 50 µl.
10469
10690
Fresh solutions of 30 µl of 10 mM hydrochinon (Sigma) and 530 µl of 3 M sodium bisulfite (pH 5.0; Sigma) were added, the solution was gently mixed, overlayed with mineral oil and incubated in the dark for 12–13 h at 50°C.
10691
10791
The aqueous phase was recovered using the ‘Wizard DNA clean-up system’ (Promega, Mannheim, Germany).
10792
10948
The purified DNA was subsequently mixed with 1 M NaOH to a final concentration of 0.3 M and incubated for 20 min at 37°C to ensure complete desulfonisation.
10949
11082
DNA was ethanol precipitated in the presence of 1/10 vol of 3 M sodium acetate, washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 50 µl H2O.
11083
11298
Subsequent PCR amplification of 4 µl bisulfite-treated DNA was used for cloning of two fragments of the IRF-4 promoter (BS-I and BS-II) into pCR2.1 vector with the ‘TOPO TA cloning kit’ (Invitrogen) (see Figure 3A).
11299
11722
The primers used for PCR amplification of the BS-I and BS-II fragments contain the putative altered sequence of the sense strand due to bisulfite treatment (converted cytosine residues are written in bold letters): BS-I-forward 5′-TATTTGGATTTTTAGGGAGTTTTTTTT-3′, BS-I-reverse 5′-ACCCAACTCCCTTAAACTATTAAACT-3′ (187 bp); BS-II-forward 5′-AGTTTAATAGTTTAAGGGAGTTGGGT-3′, BS-II-reverse 5′-CTCACCCTAAACTCAAAACTAAAAAC-3′ (674 bp).
11723
11914
After bacterial amplification of the cloned PCR fragments by standard procedures, eight clones from each sample were sequenced with an automated sequencer (ABI Prism 377, Applied Biosystems).
11917
12003
The IRF-4 promoter-reporter gene construct was generously provided by J. Hiscott (31).
12004
12191
Constructs were methylated in vitro with CpG Methylase (M.Sss I) as recommended by the manufacturer (NE Biolabs) and complete methylation was checked via restriction analysis (Figure 5A).
12192
12303
Reporter gene assays using the dual luciferase assay (Promega) were performed similar to previous reports (29).
12304
12471
Briefly, 5 nM of the reporter construct and the transfection control construct expressing the renilla luciferase gene were transientlyco-expressed via electroporation.
12472
12554
The control construct served as an internal reference for transfection efficiency.
12555
12690
Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase activity was measured with a LB 96 P microlumat (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany).
12691
12807
IRF-4 promoter activation was quantified as a ratio of measured firefly light units (flu) relative to renilla (rlu).
12808
12861
Each experiment was carried out at least three times.
12864
12871
RESULTS
12873
12989
We have previously demonstrated a lack of IRF-4 expression in leukemia patients and specifically in CML T-cells (3).
12990
13449
Here, we demonstrate the absence of IRF-4 expression in various hematopoietic cell lines, such as Jurkat, a T-cell leukemia, CML-T1, a bcr-abl-positive T-cell line, K-562, a bcr-abl-positve erythroleukemia, U-937, a monocytic leukemia, EM-2 and LAMA-84, bcr-abl-positve myeloid leukemia, but not in SD-1, a bcr-abl-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre B-ALL), RPMI-8226, a multiple myeloma and BV-173, a bcr-abl-positive B-cell line (Figures 1A and 5D).
13450
13606
After sequencing of the IRF-4 promoter, it could be excluded that absence of IRF-4 expression in any of the above cell lines was due to genetic aberrations.
13607
13779
However, 2 bp changes (nucleotide −1081, T→C and −1068, A→C) could be detected in both the IRF-4-positive BV-173 and the IRF-4-negative LAMA-84, EM-2 and K-562 (Figure 1B).
13780
13985
At position −116 an A→C substitution was found in EM-2, K-562 and CML-T1, whereas Jurkat, BV-173 and SD-1 exhibited a mixed A/C sequence and U-937, LAMA-84 and RPMI-8226 no substitution at all (Figure 1B).
13986
14058
Consequently, these alterations are unlikely to affect IRF-4 expression.
14061
14168
We next analyzed whether promoter methylation could be responsible for down-regulation of IRF-4 expression.
14169
14275
A region including exon1 in the IRF-4 promoter exhibited a large number of CpG-rich sequences (Figure 3A).
14276
14472
Several chemical substances such as 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (AzadC) or 5-azacytidine (AzaC) inhibit de novo and maintenance methylation, and thus can be used to discern promoter methylation (32,33).
14473
14516
We used AzadC to generate unmethylated DNA.
14517
14700
A 72 h AzadC-treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent activation of IRF-4 transcription in Jurkat and CML-T1 T-cells as well as in U-937, K-562 and EM-2 cell lines (Figure 2A).
14701
14868
IRF-4 transcription was induced in a time-dependent manner and was observed as early as 24 h after treatment with AzadC and increased over time until 72 h (Figure 2B).
14869
14955
Time and strength of the appearance of IRF-4 transcripts varied among cell lines, i.e.
14956
15019
CML-T1 responded strongest to AzadC-treatment (data not shown).
15020
15155
In line with this, AzadC-treatment of CML-T1 and LAMA-84 cells also translated in an induction of IRF-4 protein expression (Figure 2C).
15156
15295
Accordingly, treatment of the IRF-4-positive cell line BV-173, SD-1 and RPMI-8226 with AzadC had no effect on IRF-4 expression (Figure 2D).
15296
15437
There was no difference in the effects of AzaC versus AzadC, as both increased the IRF-4 mRNA level in CML-T1 cells as well (data not shown).
15438
15623
This implied that promoter methylation may control IRF-4 expression, but an alternative explanation may be activation of positive transcriptional regulators of IRF-4 by AzadC (or AzaC).
15626
15865
To further investigate promoter methylation as a regulatory mechanism of IRF-4 gene expression, restriction-PCR-assays were performed (20,24), where only methylated DNA would not be cut enabling subsequent PCR amplification and vice versa.
15866
16043
Genomic DNA from leukemic cells Jurkat, CML-T1, U-937, K-562, EM-2 and BV-173 was digested with the methylation-sensitive enzymes HpaII, Bsh1236I and HaeII-isochizomer Bsp143II.
16044
16169
EcoRI, which has no recognition site within the IRF-4 promoter, and the methylation-resistant enzyme MspI served as controls.
16170
16271
Two separate amplification reactions were performed, generating two fragments, F1 and F2 (Figure 3A).
16272
16558
After digestion with HpaII and Bsp143II a sufficient PCR amplification of F1 and F2 was detected in DNA from IRF-4-negative Jurkat, CML-T1, U-937, K-562 and EM-2 cells, suggesting a promoter methylation (and restriction protection) at the respective recognition sites (Figure 3B and C).
16559
16694
Notably, in IRF-4-positive SD-1 cells digestion with the methylation-sensitive enzymes completely inhibited amplification of F1 and F2.
16695
16891
In IRF-4-positive BV-173 cells a HpaII, but not a Bsh1236I digestion, significantly reduced the amplifiable DNA message of F2 (Figure 3C), whereas amplification of F1 was not affected (Figure 3B).
16892
17087
This implied that IRF-4 transcription in SD-1 and BV-173 cells is associated with less promoter methylation (in BV-173 especially at HpaII sites) as compared with the tested IRF-4-negative cells.
17090
17421
In order to exactly map the methylation sites within the IRF-4 promoter, we treated DNA of Jurkat, CML-T1, U-937, K-562 and EM-2 cells as well as of SD-1, RPMI-8226 and BV-173 control cells with bisulfite, which chemically converts unmethylated cytosine to uracil, whereas it has no effect on methylated cytosine, i.e. in CpG (34).
17422
17504
This technique is especially useful for detection of unknown methylation patterns.
17505
17684
PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of the bisulfite-treated DNA showed a specific methylation pattern of the analyzed 62 CpG sites in all cell lines (Figure 4 and Table 1).
17685
17884
In general, the methylational status ranged from one cell line with a nearly non-methylated IRF-4 promoter (SD-1, IRF-4-positive) to a completely methylated IRF-4 promoter in CML-T1 (IRF-4-negative).
17885
18079
Interestingly, the percentage of CpG methylation in the IRF-4 promoter from IRF-4-positive cells was very low (mean 24%) as compared with IRF-4-negative cells (mean 94%) (Figure 4A and Table 1).
18080
18446
A 5′-region (R1) with 13 hypermethylated CpG sites (mean number of methylated clones 5.5 of 8 with 77% methylated CpGs) was found in most cells (except SD-1 and RPMI-8226) and a 3′-region (R3) of 6 hypomethylated CpG sites (mean number of methylated clones 1.7 of 8 with 33% methylated CpGs) was found in most cells (except CML-T1 and U-937) (Figure 4A and Table 1).
18449
18726
Intriguingly, a stretch of 13 CpG sites (#10–22; R2) was detected in between these regions, which were highly methylated in IRF-4-negative (mean number of methylated clones 7.1 of 8 with 89% methylated CpGs) but totally non-methylated in IRF-4-positive cells (Figure 4A and B).
18727
18920
Furthermore, three CpG sites at the 5′ end (#54, 56, 58) and two CpG motifs at the 3′ end (#1, 2) showed this direct correlation between high methylation status and absence of IRF-4 expression.
18921
19114
In addition, two CpG sites located in a NFκB (#48) and a SP1 element (#45) are less methylated in IRF-4-positive than in IRF-4-negative cells (mean number of methylated clones: 1/8 versus 8/8).
19115
19229
These results indicate the involvement of CpG methylation in the regulation of IRF-4 expression in leukemic cells.
19232
19432
To provide evidence for a direct effect of methylational status on IRF-4 promoter activity we performed reporter gene assays with IRF-4 promoter constructs before and after their in vitro methylation.
19433
19564
A complete methylation of these constructs was checked via restriction assays with methylation-sensitive endonucleases (Figure 5A).
19565
19705
Intriguingly, methylation of the IRF-4 promoter significantly decreased promoter activity in IRF-4-positive SD-1 cells by 85.0% (Figure 5B).
19706
19907
The silencing effect of CpG methylation was not restricted to IRF-4-positive cells, since in vitro methylation led to a 92.9% abrogation of promoter activity in IRF-4-negative Jurkat cells (Figure 5C).
19908
20081
In contrast, control methylation of a reporter construct with a different promoter (FasL) as well as an empty vector had no effect on the reporter activity (data not shown).
20082
20176
These data proved a direct association between methylation and activity of the IRF-4 promoter.
20179
20405
Since abundance of DNMT and MBP contribute to promoter regulation via methylation (25,26,28), we studied their mRNA expression to investigate a possible mechanism for the observed methylation differences in the IRF-4 promoter.
20406
20603
To this end, we did not detect a significant difference in DNMT (DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B) or MBP (MBD1, MBD2, MBD4 and MeCP) mRNA expression between IRF-4-positive and -negative cells (Figure 5D).
20604
20759
In fact, all analyzed cells had moderate to high mRNA levels of these tested DNMT/MBPs and differences in expression were not correlated with IRF-4 status.
20760
20928
These results indicate a distinct cause of the methylation differences in IRF-4-positive and -negative cells rather than changes in the DNMT and MBP mRNA transcription.
20931
20941
DISCUSSION
20943
21029
Many genetic lesions are known to influence gene expression of tumor suppressor genes.
21030
21212
Whereas mutations and deletions or insertions have permanent effects, reversible mechanisms are gene methylation, or expression and activation of transcription factors, respectively.
21213
21344
We studied a putative cause for absent IRF-4 expression in leukemia cells and first focused on genetic aberrations of the promoter.
21345
21866
We observed no genetic alterations in the IRF-4 promoter, which can account for the lack of IRF-4 expression: The detected base pair changes at position −1081 (T→C substitution), at position −1068 (A→C substitution) and at position −116 (A→C substitution) are unlikely responsible for absent IRF-4-expression since the first two mutations were found both in IRF-4-positive and -negative cells whereas the latter change was not detected consistently in all IRF-4-negative or -positive cells and may thus be a polymorphism.
21867
22056
All three substitutions did not change any known putative transcription factor binding sites (30,31) and also do not affect any restriction sites or primer binding sites of the used assays.
22057
22225
However, permanent genetic variations in the IRF-4 coding sequence, such as deletions or mutations resulting in stop-codons have not been excluded by sequence analysis.
22226

Since IRF-4 expression in cell lines and CML can be induced by demethylation and successful IFN-α therapy (3), respectively, the existence of such genetic aberrations seems unlikely.
22411
22730
We then investigated whether the previously described down-regulation of IRF-4 expression in human myeloid leukemias was due to a differential hypermethylation of the promoter, since the presented re-expression due to AzadC-treatment might also be a result of activation of positive transcriptional regulators of IRF-4.
22731
22912
Methylation of CpG sites is a common mechanism of silencing genes in leukemia and has also been shown for another IRF, IRF-7 (35) and for PU.1 (36), an interacting partner of IRF-4.
22913
23115
To elucidate the relevance of this mechanism for the regulation of IRF-4 expression, various leukemic cells were treated with demethylating agents and promoters were sequenced after bisulfite treatment.
23116
23244
We found that IRF-4 expression could indeed be connected to the methylation status of distinct CpG motifs in the IRF-4 promoter.
23245
23395
In Figure 4A, those CpG sites are shown (bottom line), whose hypermethylation may account for the absence of IRF-4 expression in the respective cells.
23396
23522
One of them (#54) is adjacent to an identified regulatory element (NFκB-site), indicating a possible involvement of this site.
23523
23643
At two further CpG sites (#48, 45) the methylation status in IRF-4-positive was lower than that of IRF-4-negative cells.
23644
23771
These CpG sites are located in an NFκB and an SP1 element (31) and thus may also play a role in regulation of IRF-4 expression.
23772
23966
It has been shown that NFκB elements play an important role in IRF-4 induction as IRF-4 expression depends on binding of the transactivator c-Rel to these elements in the IRF-4 promoter (31,37).
23967
24189
Furthermore, methylation of the central CpG in the NFκB element inhibits binding of the NFκB protein complexes (38), promoting the significance of the observed methylation differences in IRF-4-positive and -negative cells.
24192
24390
Via in vitro methylation and reporter gene assays we could clearly appoint the silencing of the IRF-4 promoter to a methylation effect, which may thus be the mechanism of IRF-4 deregulation in vivo.
24391
24519
One possible cause for the aberrant methylation in tumorigenesis is an increased level of DNMTs during the pathogenetic process.
24520
24636
In colon, lung and hematologic malignancies, overexpression of DNMT1, a maintenance DNMT, has been detected (39–41).
24637
24867
Furthermore, it has been shown that CML cells in the acute phase exhibited elevated levels of the three known DNMTs, while CML cells in chronic phase expressed normal levels of DNMTs if compared with normal bone marrow cells (25).
24868
25001
Interestingly, a positive correlation between DNMT1 expression levels and hypermethylation of p15INK4b has been detected in AML (25).
25002
25212
In this work, we did not detect significant mRNA expression differences of selected DNMT or MBP, making it an unlikely cause for the observed methylation and thus IRF-4 expression differences in leukemia cells.
25215
25392
The finding that IRF-4 expression is silenced by promoter hypermethylation might represent a mechanism that accounts for the previously observed loss of IRF-4 expression in CML.
25393
25585
Indeed, several clinical trials with leukemia patients and patients with myelodysplastic syndromes demonstrated the potential clinical benefit of a treatment with demethylating agents (42–45).
25588
25732
The expression of another IRF, IFN consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP/IRF-8), is impaired in myeloid leukemias especially CML (27,46,47).
25733
25981
But in contrast to IRF-4, the loss of this IRF could not be reverted in ICSBP-negative cell lines (EM-2, CML-T1, K-562 and LAMA-84) by treatment with AzadC (Figure 6) and AzadC has no effect on ICSBP levels in ICSBP-positive U-937 cells (Figure 6).
25982
26052
These data suggest a distinct regulatory mechanism for these two IRFs.
26055
26317
IRF-4, similar to many other classical tumor suppressor genes p15INK4b, p16INK4a or p53, may thus be a subject of alterations in the promoter methylation status leading to expression changes, which might contribute to the initiation and/or progression of cancer.
26318
26457
Still, the obvious functional diversity of IRF-4 remains remarkable and cannot be fully explained by the IRF-4 promoter methylation status.
26458
26523
For example, IRF-4 is primarily known for its oncogenic features.
26524
26725
In multiple myeloma (MM) a translocation on chromosome 14q was reported to lead to a fusion gene of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) and IRF-4 resulting in a subsequent overexpression of IRF-4 (48,49).
26726
26959
In addition, abundant IRF-4 expression was found to be a marker for various subsets of lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, primary effusion lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma, and adult T-cell leukemia (11,31,50–52).
26960
27015
This draws a more complex picture of the role of IRF-4.
27016
27255
Down-regulation of IRF-4 may promote leukemogenesis in myeloid cell context (3), which was recently confirmed in IRF-4−/− ICSBP−/− double knock-out mice (53), while IRF-4 up-regulation may induce a growth advantage in lymphomas or MM (48).
27258
27474
Taken together, our data suggest that IRF-4 promoter methylation regulates IRF-4 expression, and that aberrant expression of IRF-4 in certain types of leukemia may be a consequence of IRF-4 promoter hypermethylation.
