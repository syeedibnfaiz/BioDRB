Abstract
63
130
BOB.1/OBF.1 is a lymphocyte-restricted transcriptional coactivator.
131
246
It binds together with the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors to DNA and enhances their transactivation potential.
247
385
Mice deficient for the transcriptional coactivator BOB.1/OBF.1 show several defects in differentiation, function and signaling of B cells.
386
509
In search of BOB.1/OBF.1 regulated genes we identified Btk—a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase—as a direct target of BOB.1/OBF.1.
510
643
Analyses of the human as well as murine Btk promoters revealed a non-consensus octamer site close to the start site of transcription.
644
772
Here we show that Oct proteins together with BOB.1/OBF.1 are able to form ternary complexes on these sites in vitro and in vivo.
773
882
This in turn leads to the induction of Btk promoter activity in synergism with the transcription factor PU.1.
883
905
Btk, like BOB.1/OBF.1,
906
981
plays a critical role in B cell development and B cell receptor signalling.
982
1054
Therefore the down-regulation of Btk expression in BOB.1/OBF.1-deficient
1055
1157
B cells could be related to the functional and developmental defects observed in BOB.1/OBF.1-deficient
1158
1163
mice.

INTRODUCTION
1179
1255
The octamer motif ATGCAAAT is important for B cell-specific gene regulation.
1256
1493
Although it is also found in promoters of ubiquitously expressed genes (1–3), it is a critical element in the regulatory regions of several B cell-specific expressed genes, like immunoglobulin genes (4,5), B29 (Igβ), CD20 and CD21 (6–8).
1494
1633
Detailed analyses of the octamer sequence revealed that mutations in most positions of the conserved motif interfere with its function (9).
1634
1789
In B cells, two octamer transcription factors bind to the octamer element, the ubiquitously expressed Oct1 and the lymphocyte-specific expressed Oct2 (10).
1790
1964
For B-cell-specific activity these transcription factors need to interact with an additional lymphocyte-restricted coactivator named BOB.1/OBF.1 (alternative names are Bob.1,
1965
1987
OBF-1, OCA-B) (11,12).
1988
2171
BOB.1/OBF.1 displays only weak DNA binding and is recruited to the octamer sequence predominantly via interaction of its N-terminal domain with the POU-domains of Oct factors (11–19).
2172
2303
The transactivation domains of both type of proteins—Oct and BOB.1/OBF.1—act in synergy to mediate octamer-dependent transcription.
2304
2436
A BOB.1/OBF.1 protein isoform bearing an N-terminal myristoylated extension was found to be localized in the membrane fraction (20).
2437
2488
The function of this isoform is not understood yet.
2491
2668
Gene targeting experiments revealed that BOB.1/OBF.1 is important at several stages of B cell development in the bone marrow as well as in peripheral secondary lymphoid tissues.
2669
2792
In the bone marrow the number of immature as well transitional B cells is reduced and fewer cells reach the periphery (21).
2793
2873
BOB.1/OBF.1 is expressed throughout B cell ontogeny, albeit at different levels.
2874
2941
The highest expression is found in germinal center B cells (22,23).
2942
2992
The most striking characteristic of BOB.1/OBF.1−/−
2993
3081
mice is the complete failure to form germinal centers in spleen and lymph nodes (24–26).
3082
3164
Therefore, the production of switched immunoglobulin isotypes is strongly reduced.
3165
3251
In addition, the development of the marginal zone B cell compartment in BOB.1/OBF.1−/−
3252
3283
mice is severely affected (27).
3284
3402
The B-cell-specific expression of a bcl2-transgene can rescue several aspects of early lymphopoiesis in BOB.1/OBF.1−/−
3403
3408
mice.
3409
3498
However, terminal differentiation and specific B cell responses are still defective (28).
3499
3558
BOB.1/OBF.1 is also inducible expressed in T cells (29,30).
3559
3626
A critical function in T cells has however not been identified yet.
3629
3807
Some of the defects in early and late B cell development as well as in B cell function were reminiscent of defects in mice deficient of functional Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk).
3808
3968
Mutations in the gene coding for Btk cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in humans (31) and X-linked immunodeficiency (Xid) in mice [reviewed in Ref. (32)].
3969
4184
The Xid phenotype is characterized by a defect in the transition from the pre-B to immature B cells in the bone marrow as well as by a reduced number of peripheral B cells that exhibit an immature phenotype (33–35).
4185
4245
In addition, the B-1 cell compartment is absent in Xid-mice.
4246
4301
Consequently, the levels of serum IgM and IgG3 are low.
4302
4327
Similar to BOB.1/OBF.1−/−
4328
4651
animals (25,27), mice deficient for an functional Btk show severe defects in B cell receptor signaling, expressed by reduced tyrosine phosphorylation [reviewed in (32)], reduced elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels (36), reduced activation of NF-κB (37,38) as well as impaired proliferation upon IgM crosslinking (33,34).
4652
4744
Based on these findings one may suggest that BOB.1/OBF.1 and Btk have overlapping functions.
4745
4907
However, mice mutant for both proteins almost completely lack peripheral B cells and show a severe agammaglobulinemia (39), a phenotype resembling human XLA (31).
4908
5088
Thus, although BOB.1/OBF.1 and Btk share some overlapping functions, they are also involved in distinct signaling pathways, which are important for B cell development and function.
5091
5255
To get insights into the regulation of Btk expression the human (40,41) and murine (42,43) promoter regions were analyzed for conserved regulatory elements (44–49).
5256
5352
Recently, regulatory elements necessary for Btk gene activation were also identified in intron1.
5353
5407
The btk promoter does not contain an obvious TATA box.
5408
5467
Transcription is initiated at a putative initiator element.
5468
5635
Deletion analyses revealed that a sequence of 280 bp upstream of the start site of transcription is sufficient for the cell-type-specific regulation of Btk expression.
5636
5741
The transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, Spi-B and PU.1 are able to synergistically activate the Btk promoter.
5742
5905
However, in PU.1-deficient fetal liver cells (48) as well as SP1−/− embryonic stem cells (49), Btk expression was either reduced or not affected but not abolished.
5906
6006
This indicates that additional, yet not identified factors also contribute to Btk promoter activity.
6009
6228
Here we show that the transcription factors Oct1 and Oct2 are able to bind in concert with the coactivator BOB.1/OBF.1 to a non-perfect octamer site within the human and murine Btk promoters leading to their activation.
6229
6327
Moreover, Oct and BOB.1/OBF.1 proteins activate the murine Btk promoter synergistically with PU.1.
6328
6374
The importance of the Oct/BOB.1/OBF.1-mediated
6375
6450
btk gene activation is underlined by the fact that in BOB.1/OBF.1-deficient
6451
6489
B cells expression of Btk is impaired.
6490
6672
Thus, we identified the non-perfect octamer site present in human as well in the murine Btk promoter as a conserved regulatory site important for B cell-specific btk gene regulation.

RESULTS
12362
12527
In search for BOB.1/OBF.1 target genes we analyzed the promoter regions of genes implicated in B cell development and function for the presence of the octamer motif.
12528
12701
Analyses of the human and murine Btk promoters revealed a conserved non-perfect octamer motif within the first 200 bp upstream of the start site of transcription (Figure 1).
12702
12789
Both octamer motifs differ from the consensus sequence ATGCAAAT at the second position.
12790
12897
The human Btk promoter motif bears a T→A transversion, whereas the murine variant shows a T→G transversion.
12898
13092
Since it was shown that a mutation in this position of the octamer motif interferes with Oct binding (9) we wondered whether these sites might nevertheless play a role for Btk promoter activity.
13095
13321
Initially, nuclear extracts from BJAB cells were incubated with labeled probes bearing either the consensus octamer motif or the putative octamer binding sites identified in the murine or human Btk promoters (Figure 2A and B).
13322
13505
Although complex formation was much weaker in the case of the Btk promoter sites compared with the consensus octamer motif, similar complexes could be detected upon extended exposure.
13506
13664
When the octamer motifs in the murine and human Btk promoters were further mutated and then used as probes, no specific binding could be detected (Figure 2C).
13665
13840
Furthermore, complex formation could be efficiently inhibited by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides bearing the wild-type murine or human Btk promoter octamer motifs.
13841
13939
In contrast, mutated octamer motifs failed to compete for Oct1 and Oct2 binding (Figure 2A and B).
13940
14034
Competition was much more efficient when a consensus octamer motif was used (Figure 2A and B).
14035
14152
In supershift experiments we could demonstrate that the shifted complexes contain Oct1 and Oct2 proteins (Figure 2D).
14153
14278
Oct2-specific antibodies revealed several supershifted complexes consistent with the existence of several Oct2 isoforms (57).
14279
14516
Together these findings indicate that the identified octamer motifs within the murine and human Btk promoters serve as binding sites for Oct1 and Oct2, although showing reduced affinities for Oct1 and Oct2 compared with a consensus site.
14519
14654
Next we asked, whether BOB.1/OBF.1 is able to form ternary complexes together with Oct1 and Oct2 on the murine and human Btk promoters.
14655
14803
It is extremely difficult to obtain ternary complexes even on consensus octamer motives by EMSA with endogenous proteins in B cell extracts (55,58).
14804
14858
Therefore, we used an in vitro complementation system.
14859
15070
HeLa nuclear extracts were complemented with in vitro translated BOB.1/OBF.1 and incubated with either the labeled the consensus octamer motif or the motifs found in the human or murine Btk promoters (Figure 3).
15071
15190
Indeed, ternary complex formation could be detected at these non-conserved octamer sequences (Figure 3B and C, lane 3).
15191
15308
Supershift experiments revealed that these complexes were composed of Oct1 and BOB.1/OBF.1 (Figure 3, lanes 4 and 5).
15309
15329
BOB.1/OBF.1-specific
15330
15377
antibodies prevented ternary complex formation.
15378
15535
However, an Oct1 binding was still possible under these conditions using the consensus octamer site as labeled probe (compare lanes 2, 4 and 8 in Figure 3A).
15536
15676
In contrast, only very weak Oct1 binding could be detected with the non-consensus Btk-octamer motifs (lanes 2, 4 and 8 in Figures 3B and C).
15677
15827
Moreover, the addition of anti-Oct1 antibodies leads to a clear Oct1 supershift when the consensus octamer site was used as probe (Figure 3A, lane 5).
15828
15938
In contrast, no clear Oct1 supershift could be detected with the Btk octamer sites (Figures 3B and C, lane 5).
15939
16058
However, the ternary complex formation was prevented, indicating that this complex is composed of BOB.1/OBF.1 and Oct1.
16059
16195
The addition of an anti-Oct2 antibody did not interfere with complex formation (Figure 3, lane 6), since HeLa cells do not express Oct2.
16196
16305
These data indicate that in case of the non-consensus octamer sites BOB.1/OBF.1 supports the binding of Oct1.
16308
16472
To investigate whether BOB.1/OBF.1 binds to the Btk promoter in vivo, ChIP experiments were performed using primary B cells isolated from spleens of wild-type mice.
16473
16634
Oct1, Oct2 and BOB.1/OBF.1 are all bound to the murine Btk promoter in B cells in vivo albeit with reduced affinity in comparison to the H2B promoter (Figure 4).
16635
16777
To control for the specificity of the ChIP experiments, antibodies recognizing unrelated proteins (PLCγ1 and Lyn) were used for precipitation.
16778
16832
No signals were observed in these controls (Figure 4).
16833
16967
In addition, no binding of any of these proteins to the murine Pax5 promoter that does not contain an octamer motif could be observed.
16970
17131
Since we observed binding of BOB.1/OBF.1 together with Oct to the Btk promoter, we asked whether this binding results in the activation of Btk promoter activity.
17132
17329
Therefore, the murine Btk promoter was cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene and transfected into NIH/3T3 cells along with Oct2, BOB.1/OBF1 or with combinations of these expression vectors.
17330
17531
Consistent with our binding studies, we observed that BOB.1/OBF.1 together with Oct2 was able to activate the murine Btk promoter ∼150-fold in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5A, B and data not shown).
17532
17670
Notably, Oct2 together with BOB.1/OBF.1 was a potent inducer of Btk promoter activity, whereas Oct1 had no effect at all (data not shown).
17671
17954
Since the transcription factor PU.1 was shown to be important for the Btk promoter activity and the PU.1 sites are conserved between the human and murine Btk promoters (Figure 1), we wondered whether Oct2 and BOB.1/OBF.1 can enhance PU.1-mediated transactivation of the Btk promoter.
17955
18106
Transfection experiments using NIH/3T3 cells revealed that BOB.1/OBF.1 together with PU.1 only marginally enhanced PU.1-mediated Btk promoter activity.
18107
18245
In contrast, co-transfection of Oct2 together with PU.1 stimulated PU.1-mediated Btk promoter activity significantly (from 6- to 75-fold).
18246
18416
Moreover, co-transfection of PU.1 together with Oct2 and BOB.1/OBF.1 led to an even stronger and synergistic activation (325-fold) of the murine Btk promoter (Figure 5C).
18417
18618
In conclusion these findings indicate that the transcriptional coactivator BOB.1/OBF.1 regulates the Btk promoter activity in B cells in vitro as well as in vivo, in concert with Oct and PU.1 proteins.
18621
18754
To further analyze the in vivo relevance of the Btk promoter octamer motif we mutated the octamer sequence from AGGCAAAT to AGtacAAT.
18755
18828
This mutation prevented binding of Oct transcription factors (Figure 2C).
18829
18991
When this mutated construct was transfected into the murine B cell line S194 the activity was reduced to 60% compared with the wild-type Btk promoter (Figure 6A).
18992
19138
This demonstrates that the octamer motif significantly contributes to overall promoter activity in addition to the PU.1 and Sp1/Sp3 binding sites.
19141
19267
A prediction based on this result would be that Btk expression should be attenuated in B cells lacking BOB.1/OBF.1 expression.
19268
19412
We therefore examined IL-7-dependent and stroma cell-dependent pre B cell lines established from the bone marrow of wild type and BOB.1/OBF.1−/−
19413
19452
mice for expression of Btk (Figure 6B).
19453
19512
Indeed, Btk protein expression is reduced in BOB.1/OBF.1−/−
19513
19525
pre B cells.
19526
19712
The requirement of BOB.1/OBF.1 for Btk expression in pre-B cell lines was further analysed in IL-7-dependent cell lines expressing a conditional BOB.1/OBF.1 transgene on a BOB.1/OBF.1−/−
19713
19731
mutant background.
19732
19820
To achieve conditional expression of BOB.1.OBF.1 the tet-off system was used (27,56,59).
19821
19958
In the absence of Doxycyclin (Dox) the co-activator BOB.1/OBF.1 is expressed, whereas in the presence of Dox its expression is repressed.
19959
20067
RNA was prepared from either untreated or Dox treated pre-B cells and analysed in northern blot experiments.
20068
20267
When BOB.1/OBF.1 expression was shut-off by doxycyclin addition, the expression of Btk was reduced further supporting the clear dependence of Btk expression in pre-B cells on BOB.1/OBF.1 (Figure 6C).
20268
20472
To investigate, whether the down-regulation of Btk expression in the absence of BOB.1/OBF.1 is also seen in mature B220+ cells, these cells were sorted by FACS from spleens of wild type and BOB.1/OBF.1−/−
20473
20513
mice and analyzed by protein immunoblot.
20514
20580
Again, Btk expression was strongly reduced in B220+ BOB.1/OBF.1−/−
20581
20634
cells in comparison with wild-type cells (Figure 6D).
20635
20737
Furthermore, in northern blot analyses of RNA prepared from splenocytes of wild type or BOB.1/OBF.1−/−
20738
20832
mice a reduced Btk–mRNA expression was detected when BOB.1/OBF.1 is not expressed (Figure 6E).
20833
20964
Together, these experiments clearly indicate the physiological importance of BOB.1/OBF.1 for the B-cell-specific expression of Btk.
20967
20977
DISCUSSION
20979
21118
The regulation of B cell type-specific gene expression plays an essential role for B cell generation, maturation, development and function.

21228
A large number of transcription factors have been shown to be involved in the regulation of B cell fate (60).
21229
21385
One of those factors is the transcriptional coactivator BOB.1/OBF.1, which enhances the transcriptional activity of the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors.
21386
21527
To get more insights into the physiological role of BOB.1/OBF.1 the transcriptional network controlled by BOB.1/OBF.1 needs to be elucidated.
21530
21590
Here we show that BOB.1/OBF.1 regulates Btk gene expression.
21591
21831
Although the Btk promoter had been analyzed quite extensively for binding of transcription factors (44–49), the presence of a functional octamer site within the first 200 bp upstream of the start site of transcription had not been reported.
21832
22126
Although footprint experiments identified a protected region in the human Btk promoter region extending from −130 to −152 bp (the human Btk promoter octamer motif is located at −145 to −152 bp; see Figure 1), this area was only analyzed for the binding of Sp1/3 factors to the GC rich box (48).
22127
22244
In addition, the DNA probe used in gel shift experiments to detect Sp1/3 binding did not encompass the octamer motif.
22245
22364
Therefore, protein–DNA complexes reflecting Oct binding to the Btk promoter could not be observed in these experiments.
22365
22663
Furthermore, in search for factors involved in cell-type-specific Btk expression, those protein complexes observed in gel shift experiments were excluded from detailed analyses that were found to bind to the Btk promoter also in cells were Btk is not expressed such as T cells and fibroblasts (46).
22664
22777
However, Oct proteins are not exclusively expressed in B cells and Oct1 is also found in T cells and fibroblasts.
22778
22976
We could show that Oct1 as well Oct2 are able to bind to the murine as well to the human Btk promoter, albeit this binding activity was much weaker than that observed using a consensus octamer site.
22977
23123
In addition, ternary complexes composed of Oct1 and BOB.1/OBF.1 could be detected on the murine and human Btk Oct sites in a reconstituted system.
23124
23276
This clearly demonstrates that Oct proteins together with BOB.1/OBF.1 are able to bind to the non-perfect Oct motifs found in the Btk promoter in vitro.
23277
23473
Interestingly, whereas in the absence of BOB.1/OBF.1 only a weak binding of Oct factors was observed, the ternary complex formation was found similar to that formed on the consensus octamer motif.
23476
23554
Similar results were observed when the Oct-dependent and BOB.1/OBF.1-dependent
23555
23602
osteopontin promoter had been analyzed (61,62).
23603
23776
This promoter contains a PORE (Palindromic Oct factor Recognition Element; ATTTG(N5)CAAAT) that enables Oct factors to assemble homo- or hetero-dimers at this site in vitro.
23777
23914
The PORE-mediated Oct dimerization was suggested to be an essential prerequisite for binding of BOB.1/OBF.1 to such an octamer site (63).
23915
24086
These studies also demonstrated that the transversion T→G at the second position of the consensus octamer site (identified in the murine Btk promoter) impairs Oct binding.
24087
24247
However, luciferase reporter assays revealed that the T→G transversion results in increased promoter activity in comparison to the wild-type PORE promoter (62).
24248
24406
In line with this observation it was shown that the presence of BOB.1/OBF.1 enables Oct factors to bind to this unfavorable non-consensus octamer motifs (62).
24407
24576
Although the octamer motifs identified in Btk promoter do not represent classical PORE motifs, we show here that Oct proteins and BOB.1/OBF.1 bind to this site in vitro.
24577
24699
Thus the presence of BOB.1/OBF.1 facilitates binding of Oct proteins to at least a subset of non-consensus octamer motifs.
24702
24779
ChiP experiments revealed that ternary complex formation also occurs in vivo.
24780
24959
Furthermore, Oct and BOB.1/OBF.1 proteins act in synergy with PU.1—a previously identified factor important for Btk promoter regulation (46,48,49)—to induce Btk promoter activity.
24960
25207
Since the PU.1 binding site identified in the human Btk promoter is conserved and present in the murine Btk promoter (Figure 1) we suggest that the mechanism of Btk gene regulation by Oct/BOB.1/OBF.1 and PU.1 is conserved between mouse and humans.
25208
25365
The importance of PU.1 for Btk gene regulation is underlined by the fact that the absence of PU.1 leads to a two- to 3-fold reduction of Btk expression (48).
25366
25508
In contrast, the deficiency of Sp1 that also stimulates Btk promoter activity together with PU.1 (49) had no influence on Btk expression (49).
25509
25551
Here we showed that BOB.1/OBF.1-deficiency
25552
25687
results in a severe reduction of Btk expression in immature bone marrow derived pre-B cells as well as in peripheral B220+ splenocytes.
25688
25861
These data indicate the physiological importance of Oct/BOB.1/OBF.1 together with PU.1 in B cell-specific Btk gene regulation at early and late stages of B cell development.
25864
25984
If Btk is a direct target of BOB.1/OBF.1 the phenotype of mice deficient in either BOB.1/OBF.1 or Btk should be related.
25985
26213
Indeed, both knock-out mice share similar characteristics, like defects in B cell development in bone marrow and spleen, resulting in a 2- to 4-fold reduction of peripheral B cell number and defects in B cell receptor signaling.
26214
26350
However, both knock-out mice have also unique features: whereas the marginal zone B cell compartment is almost missing in BOB.1/OBF.1−/−
26351
26409
mice (27) this B cell subset was found normal in Xid mice.
26410
26505
In contrast, the B-1 population is depleted in Xid mice (33,34,64) and normal in BOB.1/OBF.1−/−
26506
26511
mice.
26512
26604
In addition, mice mutant for both proteins show a more severe defect than each mouse itself.
26605
26685
This phenotype resembles that of severe agammaglobulinemia in human XLA (31,39).
26686
26791
Therefore, Btk and BOB.1/OBF.1 seem to be involved in overlapping as well as distinct signaling pathways.
26794
26912
Taken together, the analyses of the murine and human Btk promoter revealed the presence of a functional octamer motif.
26913
27026
The transcription factors Oct1/2 as well as the coactivator BOB.1/OBF.1 bind to these sites in vitro and in vivo.
27027
27097
The physiological relevance of the octamer was shown in BOB.1/OBF.1−/−
27098
27153
B cells were the expression of Btk is strongly reduced.
27154
27430
The finding that the presence of BOB.1/OBF.1 facilitates the binding of Oct factors to the non-consensus octamer sequence identified in the human and murine Btk promoters could reflect a mechanism of fine-tuned regulation of promoter activity depending on Oct and BOB.1/OBF.1.
