Abstract
79
223
We have previously described enrichment of antigen-presenting HLA-DR+ nuclear RelB+ dendritic cells (DCs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium.
224
379
CD123+HLA-DR+ plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and their precursors have been identified in human peripheral blood (PB), lymphoid tissue, and some inflamed tissues.
380
545
We hypothesized recruitment of pDCs into the inflamed RA synovial environment and their contribution as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and inflammatory cells in RA.
546
761
CD11c+ myeloid DCs and CD123+ pDCs were compared in normal and RA PB, synovial fluid (SF), and synovial tissue by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy and were sorted for functional studies.
762
922
Nuclear RelB-CD123+ DCs were located in perivascular regions of RA, in a similar frequency to nuclear RelB+CD123- DCs, but not normal synovial tissue sublining.
923
1041
Apart from higher expression of HLA-DR, the numbers and phenotypes of SF pDCs were similar to those of normal PB pDCs.
1042
1338
While the APC function of PB pDCs was less efficient than that of PB myeloid DCs, RA SF pDCs efficiently activated resting allogeneic PB T cells, and high levels of IFN-γ, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor α were produced in response to incubation of allogeneic T cells with either type of SF DCs.
1339
1483
Thus, pDCs are recruited to RA synovial tissue and comprise an APC population distinct from the previously described nuclear RelB+ synovial DCs.
1484
1556
pDCs may contribute significantly to the local inflammatory environment.

Introduction
1572
1822
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a distinct population of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with the capacity for potent antigen-presenting function and production of large amounts of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IFN-α.
1823
2048
Human pDCs can be identified by cell-surface expression of MHC molecules, the α-chain of the IL-3 receptor (CD123), and the presence of blood dendritic-cell (DC) antigens known as BDCA2 and BDCA4 in a proportion of cells [1].
2049
2159
In comparison with CD11c+ myeloid DCs, pDCs display a distinct set of chemokine and Toll-like receptors [2-4].
2160
2276
In response to viruses and CpG DNA, pDCs become activated to produce IFN-α and their APC function is enhanced [5-8].
2277
2510
While pDCs were first demonstrated in the T-cell areas of lymph nodes [5,9], precursors of this DC population have been isolated from several sources, including normal peripheral blood (PB), thymus, fetal liver, and bone marrow [10].
2511
2779
Although they do not reside in normal peripheral tissues, pDCs have been shown to infiltrate certain inflamed tissues and tumor sites, including the skin in psoriasis and lupus, the cerebrospinal fluid in multiple sclerosis, and melanoma and ovarian carcinoma [11-15].
2780
3057
While pDCs play an important effector role in viral disease, being the major producers of IFN-α and having a primary role in innate immunity, there is also evidence that they may play an immunoregulatory role, through the induction of Th2 (T helper 2)-type cytokines [9,16-18].
3060
3273
The synovial autoimmune reaction of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by lymphocyte, macrophage, and DC infiltration that can progress to the development of lymphoid tissue in established disease [19-21].
3274
3438
DCs are likely to contribute to the formation and maintenance of such organized lymphoid tissue and antigen presentation in RA and other autoimmune lesions [22-24].
3439
3637
We have previously shown that the effector site in RA synovial tissue is enriched in differentiated myeloid DCs, which express CD33, CD11c, MHC and costimulatory molecules, and nuclear RelB [21,25].
3638
3801
Translocation of RelB to the nucleus of myeloid DCs is associated with APC function, particularly through increased expression of MHC molecules CD86 and CD40 [26].
3804
3922
The proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β are key contributors to the inflammatory cytokine cascade in RA [27,28].
3923
4077
This relates to a number of actions, but activation of the endothelium by TNF-α is particularly important in cellular recruitment to the synovium [29-31].
4078
4283
Since RA is characterized by endothelial activation, leukocyte recruitment, and the development of high endothelial venules, we hypothesized that pDCs would be enriched in inflamed but not normal synovium.
4284
4567
Since the functional role of pDCs in disease pathogenesis is only partly understood, we also wished to address whether these cells represent a population distinct from the described nuclear RelB+ synovial DCs, and whether they may contribute as APCs or inflammatory cells in RA [21].

Materials and methods
4593
4695
Thirty patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA were included [32].
4696
4773
Of these, 10 provided synovial fluid (SF) samples and 27 provided PB samples.
4774
4935
Of the 30 patients, 80% were seropositive, 62% were female, and 73% were taking at least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug or low-dose prednisone or both.
4936
5133
Synovial tissue was obtained at arthroscopy from seven patients with RA, of whom three were untreated and four were taking at least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug and low-dose prednisone.
5134
5186
The duration of disease ranged from 0.5 to 18 years.
5187
5429
In addition, we studied synovial tissue from four healthy individuals with nonspecific knee pain undergoing arthroscopy, one patient who had had psoriatic arthritis for 8 years, and one patient who had had ankylosing spondylitis for 30 years.
5430
5493
Each patient with spondyloarthropathy was taking sulfasalazine.
5494
5539
No patient in the study was taking biologics.
5540
5634
Synovial tissue was provided by Dr Malcolm Smith (Repatriation Hospital, Adelaide, Australia).
5635
5768
PB buffy coats prepared from 30 healthy donors were obtained from the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service (Brisbane, QLD, Australia).
5769
5860
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Princess Alexandra Hospital.
5863
6212
All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Life Technologies, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia) supplemented with 10% FCS (CSL Ltd, Parkville, VIC, Australia), 0.3 mg/ml L-glutamine (Trace Biosciences, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia), 0.12 mg/ml benzylpenicillin (CSL), and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (Delta West, Pharmacia and Upjohn, Spring Hill, QLD, Australia).
6213
6819
The monoclonal antibodies used in this study include FITC, phycoerythrin (PE), and purified anti-CD11c, CD14-PerCP, PE, biotinylated and purified anti-CD123, CD86-FITC (all from BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), BDCA2-FITC (Miltenyi Biotech, San Francisco, CA, USA), HLA-DR-biotin (Coulter Immunotech, Fullerton, CA, USA), CD40-FITC (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), CD80-FITC (Cymbus Biotech, Chandlers Ford, Hants, UK), CD68 (Kp-1, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA), RelB (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and biotinylated Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).
6822
7002
Mononuclear cells were prepared from normal or RA PB or RA SF by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) as described elsewhere [33].
7003
7468
T cells were purified from PB mononuclear cells by passing the cells over a nylon wool column, followed by immunomagnetic depletion of remaining monocytes, DCs, B cells, and NK (natural killer) cells using monoclonal antibodies against CD14, CD16, CD19, CD56, and HLA-DR (all from BD Pharmingen), followed by goat antimouse immunoglobulin magnetic beads, then passage through a strong magnetic field (MACS, Miltenyi Biotech), and collection of the unbound fraction.
7469
7561
On analysis by flow cytometry, the unbound fraction routinely contained 95–98% CD3+ T cells.
7562
7743
DC-enriched non-T cells were produced by immunomagnetic depletion of T, B, and NK cells from non-T cells, by incubation with monoclonal antibodies against CD19, CD16, CD56, and CD3.
7746
7993
To enumerate CD123+ and CD11c+ subsets of DCs, mononuclear cells from normal PB or RA SF were stained for four-colour flow cytometry as described elsewhere [33], using monoclonal antibodies against CD14-PECy5, CD11c-FITC, CD123-PE, and HLA-DR-APC.
7994
8054
Live CD14-HLA-DR+ mononuclear cells were gated for analysis.
8055
8129
Subset percentages are expressed as percentage of total mononuclear cells.
8130
8227
Listmode data were analyzed using Winlist 2.0 software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME, USA).
8228
8443
For sorting, PB or SF DC-enriched non-T cells stained with the same four markers were sorted using the Moflo flow cytometer (DAKO), gating on CD14-HLA-DR+ and either CD123+CD11c- or CD11c+CD123- cells, respectively.
8444
8665
For phenotypic analysis, mononuclear cells from PB or SF were stained with CD14-PECy5, CD123-PE or CD11c-PE, HLA-DR-APC, and either a fourth monoclonal antibody or isotype control monoclonal antibody conjugated with FITC.
8666
8700
DCs were gated as described above.
8703
8790
Electron microscopy of freshly sorted cells was carried out as described elsewhere [5].
8791
8947
After fixation in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were post-fixed with an aqueous solution of 1% OsO4 containing 1.5% K4Fe(CN)6.
8948
9036
Subsequently, the specimens were dehydrated in an alcohol series and embedded into epon.
9037
9200
Ultrathin sections (50 nm) were contrasted with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and studied with a CM100 electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands).
9203
9351
Various numbers of sorted PB or RA SF DCs were incubated with 105 allogeneic PB T cells in triplicate wells for 5 days, as described elsewhere [33].
9352
9492
Supernatants were removed from some cultures and [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well, ICN Biochemicals) was added to the remainder for the final 18 h.
9493
9694
Cells were harvested onto glass-fiber filter mats and the incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (Packard Topcount, Packard Instrument Co, Meriden, CT, USA).
9695
9798
IFN-γ, IL-10, and TNF-α were measured in supernatants by ELISA using OptEIA ELISA kits (BD Pharmingen).
9801
10008
Frozen or paraffin-embedded sections of synovial tissue from patients with untreated active RA were obtained by arthroscopic biopsy and supplied by Malcolm Smith (Repatriation Hospital, Adelaide, Australia).
10009
10160
Normal synovial tissue was obtained at arthroscopy from patients undergoing arthroscopy for nonspecific knee pain and in whom no abnormality was found.
10161
10322
After fixation with acetone, sections were stained with anti-CD11c or anti-CD123 using an immunoperoxidase technique, and revealed with diaminobenzidine (brown).
10323
10583
Frozen sections were double-stained with U. europaeus agglutinin I (Ulex), a lectin that specifically binds endothelial cells (fast red), and anti-CD123 (brown), using a double, immunoperoxidase–immunoalkaline phosphatase technique as described elsewhere [34].
10584
10813
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were antigen-retrieved in 10 mM citrate buffer at pH6 in an autoclave, then stained with anti-CD123 (diaminobenzidine, brown) alone, or in combination with anti-RelB (BCIP, DAKO, purple).
10814
11011
Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin except when they had been double-stained for CD123 and RelB and were photographed using a transmitted-light microscope (Leitz Diaplan, Leica, Germany).
11012
11145
To quantitate infiltration by CD123+ DCs, the number of CD123+Ulex- cells was counted in sections double-stained with CD123 and Ulex.
11146
11360
Cells were counted in each of the entire sections from three patients and three normal controls at high power, and for each biopsy this number was corrected for the area of the section to obtain the number per mm2.
11361
11554
To quantitate infiltration by CD11c+ cells, the number of these cells was counted in three high-power fields of the synovial sublining in sections from three patients and three normal controls.
11557
11616
Differences were analyzed using unpaired Student's t-tests.

Results
11628
11836
We have previously shown that synovial tissue in RA and spondyloarthropathy is enriched in differentiated myeloid DCs that express CD33, CD11c, MHC class II, costimulatory molecules, and nuclear RelB [21,25].
11837
11941
Translocation of RelB to the nucleus is associated with maturation and APC function of myeloid DCs [26].
11942
12033
These nuclear RelB+ DCs are absent in normal synovial tissue and are rare in RA SF [21,23].
12034
12271
To determine whether RA synovial tissue was infiltrated by CD123+ pDCs in addition to CD11c+ myeloid cells, frozen synovial tissue sections, either normal or from patients with RA or spondyloarthropathy, were stained with CD11c or CD123.
12272
12388
CD11c+ cells were found both in the lining layer and adjacent to vessels in the sublining of normal synovial tissue.
12389
12473
In contrast, CD123 only stained endothelial cells in the normal tissue (Fig. 1a,1b).
12474
12592
In RA synovial tissue, CD11c again stained cells adjacent to vessels, now within lymphoid aggregates in the sublining.
12593
12718
A population of CD123+ cells with dendritic appearance was also stained adjacent to CD123+ blood vessels in RA (Fig. 1c,1d,).
12719
12866
Cells expressing TNF-α in RA synovial tissue were found in a similar location in serial sections (data not shown), as demonstrated previously [35].
12867
13056
To confirm the perivascular CD123+ cells in synovial tissue, normal and RA synovial tissue were double-stained with the endothelial cell marker Ulex agglutinin (red) and with CD123 (brown).
13057
13325
Whereas all CD123+ structures in normal synovial tissue colocalized with Ulex agglutinin (orange), single-stained CD123+ cells (brown) were located in perivascular lymphoid aggregates and within the lumen of occasional blood vessels in RA synovial tissue (Fig. 1e,1f).
13326
13606
These CD123+ cells are similar in appearance to those previously demonstrated as CD123+ pDCs in human tonsil, in that they are smaller than CD11c+ myeloid DCs, with shorter dendritic processes, and cell clusters gave the appearance of locally proliferating cells (Fig. 1g) [5,36].
13607
13731
While some macrophages can express CD123, there was no colocalization in synovial tissue of CD123 and CD68 (data not shown).
13732
13854
However, aside from the dendritic morphology, we cannot exclude that some of the CD123+ cells stained are mast cells [37].
13855
14029
To determine whether CD123+ cells in synovial tissue were also nuclear RelB+, formalin-fixed tissue was double-stained for RelB and CD123 without hematoxylin counterstaining.
14030
14138
No CD123+ cells had translocated RelB to the nucleus, although some expressed cytoplasmic RelB (Fig. 1h,1i).
14139
14232
In contrast, nuclear staining of RelB was evident in adjacent CD123- cells (Fig. 1h, arrows).
14233
14417
All patients with RA showed similar infiltration by pDCs and no differences in the cell numbers or location were noted between patients with RA or spondyloarthropathy (data not shown).
14420
14618
We quantitated pDCs in normal or RA synovial tissue by counting CD123+Ulex- cells in synovial tissue sections from patients with RA or normal controls stained with CD123 and Ulex as shown in Fig. 1.
14619
14742
Whereas no pDCs infiltrated the normal tissue, approximately 22 pDCs per mm2 were identified within the RA tissue (Fig. 2).
14743
14865
This number is similar to the number of nuclear RelB+ differentiated DCs identified previously in RA synovial tissue [38].
14866
15000
In contrast, CD11c+ cells infiltrated both normal and RA synovial tissue, with significantly larger numbers in RA (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2).
15001
15224
We conclude that the CD123+ cell population is most likely a pDC population that infiltrates RA and spondyloarthropathy but not normal synovial tissue and that it is distinct from the described nuclear RelB+ DCs [21,36,39].
15225
15315
CD11c+ cells comprise immature and differentiated myeloid DCs as well as monocytes [1,34].
15316
15471
Differentiated nuclear RelB+ DCs are found within the CD11c+ DC population in RA and other inflammatory arthritides but not in normal synovial tissue [21].
15474
15618
Workers in our laboratory have previously shown that RA SF is enriched in CD11c+CD33brightCD14- myeloid DCs with efficient APC function [25,40].
15619
15739
However, when freshly isolated, only a small proportion of SF CD33brightCD14- DCs have translocated RelB to the nucleus.
15740
15831
RA and normal PB mononuclear cells contain similar proportions of CD33brightCD14- DCs [25].
15832
15992
To examine plasmacytoid and myeloid DCs in parallel, we compared RA SF with RA and healthy, control PB for the proportion of CD123+ and CD11c+ HLA-DR+CD14- DCs.
15993
16171
After purification of mononuclear cells from either normal or RA PB or RA SF by gradient centrifugation, cells were stained with CD123-PE, CD11c-FITC, CD14-PECy5, and HLA-DR-APC.
16172
16257
Polymorphonuclear cells were excluded on the basis of forward and side light-scatter.
16258
16385
Since basophils and monocytes can also express CD123, potential CD123+ non-DCs were excluded by gating CD14-HLA-DR+ cells [10].
16386
16487
By four-color analysis, CD14-HLA-DR+CD123+ and CD11c+ DC populations could be distinguished (Fig. 3).
16488
16592
The percentages of CD123+CD11c- pDCs in RA PB and normal PB were low and did not differ from each other.
16593
16718
This observation contrasts with the reduction in pDCs observed in blood from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [41].
16719
16869
CD11c+CD123- myeloid DCs were more common than CD123+ DCs in patient and control blood (P < 0.005), in keeping with previous studies of normal PB [1].
16870
17039
RA SF contained a significantly greater percentage of CD11c+ DCs than normal or RA PB (P < 0.005) – in accord with previous studies using the markers CD33 and CD14 [40].
17040
17130
The proportion of CD11c+ DCs in RA SF was higher than that of RA SF CD123+ DCs (P < 0.05).
17131
17251
Although the difference was small, the percentage of CD123+ DCs in RA SF was higher than in RA or control PB (P < 0.05).
17252
17415
The data show that CD123+ DCs are present in RA SF, and that the ratio of CD11c+ to CD123+ DCs is similar in RA SF to that in normal or RA PB (approximately 10:1).
17416
17552
In RA synovial tissue, mature myeloid nuclear RelB+ and CD123+ DCs have infiltrated perivascular lymphoid aggregates in similar numbers.
17553
17659
Previously, similar numbers of immature and mature myeloid DCs were identified in RA synovial tissue [42].
17660
17721
Thus pDCs make up about 30% of DCs within RA synovial tissue.
17722
17917
The present and previously published data, taken together, show that both pDCs and myeloid DCs are recruited to RA synovium, with an enrichment of pDCs in synovial tissue relative to blood or SF.
17920
18044
In normal PB, pDCs circulate as precursors with the potential for recruitment into tissues in response to chemokines [2,43].
18045
18365
These precursors exhibit a characteristic plasmacytoid morphology on electron microscopy, a cell-surface phenotype characterized by expression of the BDCA2 antigen, by low levels of costimulatory molecule expression, and by the potential for IFN-α production in response to viral or immunostimulatory CpG DNA motifs [1].
18366
18480
We therefore analyzed the characteristics of sorted RA SF CD123+ DCs and compared them with control PB CD123+ DCs.
18481
18652
On electron microscopic examination, freshly sorted PB and SF CD123+ DCs appeared similar, with a smooth surface and abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm.
18653
18754
The nucleus was nonlobulated and abundant in euchromatin and contained a distinct nucleolus (Fig. 4).
18755
18875
CD11c+ PB DCs were morphologically distinct from the CD123+ pDCs, with a lobulated nucleus and some phagocytic vesicles.
18876
18977
CD11c+ DCs from SF showed more membrane ruffling and phagocytic activity than those from PB (Fig. 4).
18978
19215
Thus SF CD123+ DCs morphologically resemble CD123+ DCs in PB, whereas CD11c+ SF DCs display a greater level of ruffling and phagocytic activity, consistent with their enhanced level of activation, than CD11c+ circulating precursors [21].
19218
19338
On four-color flow cytometric analysis, gated RA SF CD14-HLA-DR+CD123+ DCs expressed low levels of CD40, CD80, and CD86.
19339
19434
All or the majority of SF CD123+ DCs expressed the BDCA2 marker of immature pDC precursors [1].
19435
19636
This cell-surface phenotype closely resembles that of control PB CD123+ DC precursors, although BDCA2 was consistently expressed at high levels only by a subset of CD123+ HLA-DR+ cells in PB (Fig. 4b).
19637
19717
No PB or SF cells expressed the DC differentiation marker CD83 (data not shown).
19718
19907
However, SF CD123+ and CD11c+ DCs expressed higher levels of cell-surface HLA-DR than the corresponding cells in PB, suggesting some cellular activation within the SF environment [5,10,44].
19908
20059
Thus CD123+ pDCs comprise a small proportion of RA SF mononuclear cells, which are predominantly immature but show some evidence of activation in situ.
20060
20180
These observations regarding phenotype and PB and SF numbers are consistent with findings in two recent studies [39,45].
20183
20343
We have previously shown that freshly isolated CD33brightCD14-CD11c+ SF DCs efficiently stimulate resting T cells in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions [21].
20344
20573
In contrast, whereas freshly isolated CD11c+ PB DCs are efficient APCs in mixed lymphocyte reactions, CD123+ PB DCs usually require prior activation in the presence of IL-3 and CD154 for acquisition of APC function in this assay.
20574
20755
To analyse the functional capability of RA SF DCs, CD11c+ and CD123+ DCs were sorted from either normal PB or RA SF and incubated with freshly isolated normal allogeneic PB T cells.
20756
20918
Freshly isolated PB CD11c+ but not CD123+ DCs efficiently stimulated allogeneic T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ and IL-10 production in mixed lymphocyte reactions.
20919
21081
Addition of IL-3 made no difference to the T-cell proliferation in response to CD123+ DCs (data not shown), suggesting that death of the APCs was not responsible.
21082
21256
In contrast, both freshly isolated CD11c+ and CD123+ SF DCs efficiently stimulated proliferation and IFN-γ and IL-10 production by resting normal allogeneic T cells (Fig. 5).
21257
21352
A recent study demonstrated the capacity of RA SF to inhibit pDC differentiation in vitro [39].
21353
21589
The current studies are consistent, in that SF pDCs showed only some evidence of activation in situ, but once incubated in mixed lymphocyte reactions in the absence of SF they displayed enhanced APC function relative to that of PB pDCs.
21590
21812
Whereas stimulation of mixed lymphocyte reactions either by CD11c+ or by CD123+ PB DCs resulted in little TNF-α production, stimulation by either of these DCs from RA SF resulted in high levels of TNF-α secretion (Fig. 5).
21813
21945
The data indicate that pDCs have the capacity for enhanced APC function relative to PB pDCs once removed from the RA SF environment.
21946
22216
Furthermore, at the time of antigen presentation by SF DCs to T cells, production of a number of cytokines by either T cells or DCs may be stimulated, including TNF-α, and this appears to be a characteristic of RA synovial DCs rather than the subtype of stimulating DCs.
22219

Discussion
22231
22417
Ongoing inflammation in RA involves positive feedback loops between activated T cells, B cells, DCs, macrophages, and their products, with destructive consequences for parenchymal cells.
22418
22630
Clinical and animal data indicate that effector-site DCs play an important proinflammatory role in the perpetuation of autoimmune disease and contribute to the lymph-node-like organization of that tissue [22,46].
22631
22787
This role may be effected by local antigen presentation to CD4+ and CD8+ effector cells, but DC cytokine and chemokine secretion are also important [47,48].
22788
22951
TNF-α and IL-1β are important downstream proinflammatory and destructive cytokines in RA for somatic cells, whose release is promoted by activation of macrophages.
22952
23044
IL-10 is highly expressed in RA, and IFN-γ is an important T-cell effector cytokine [49,50].
23047
23289
In the current studies, we show that, in addition to the previously described population of nuclear RelB+ DCs, a further population of nuclear RelB-CD123+ pDCs is located in perivascular regions of RA but not normal synovial tissue sublining.

Moreover, pDCs were located within blood vessels, and both DC populations were observed in perivascular areas in which cells producing TNF-α were colocated [35].
23452
23583
Adherence of CD123+ and CD11c+ DCs to TNF-α-activated endothelium was higher than to resting endothelium in vitro (data not shown).
23584
23941
TNF-α plays an important role in the recruitment of other leukocytes to RA synovial tissue [29], and this most likely pertains to the recruitment of pDCs to RA but not normal synovial tissue through expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, CD62-E, and CD62-P and interaction with their ligands on pDCs [9,11,51-54].
23942
24024
Furthermore, TNF-α up-regulates synthesis of chemokines by endothelial cells [55].
24025
24153
During experimentally elicited allergic rhinitis, CD123+HLA-DR+ pDCs have been shown to be recruited to human nasal mucosa [11].
24156
24262
The gene for MxA is specifically induced by IFN-α and therefore identifies a population of activated pDCs.
24263
24311
In contrast, BDCA2 is a marker of immature pDCs.
24312
24404
MxA+ pDCs have previously been demonstrated in involved lupus skin and inflamed tonsil [13].
24405
24620
In RA synovial tissue, BDCA2 was shown to stain fewer cells than CD123 or MxA, suggesting differentiation in situ of a large proportion of pDCs into cells with a capacity for production of IFN-α and other cytokines.
24621
24829
Together, the current and previous studies demonstrate recruitment of pDCs to normal lymphoid organs as well as inflammatory sites, with local differentiation, but no recruitment to normal peripheral tissues.
24830
25056
In contrast, CD11c+ myeloid precursors populate normal resting tissues, as shown here, but additional CD11c+ myeloid cellular recruitment takes place at inflammatory sites, where RelB nuclear translocation takes place [21,56].
25057
25182
We have previously shown that, like synovial pDCs, CD123+ DCs in the T-cell area of human tonsil are also nuclear RelB- [23].
25183
25445
The data suggest either that activation of pDCs is not associated with nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of RelB or that conditions in tonsil and synovium do not induce sufficient RelB translocation for detection by immunohistochemistry [26,57].
25446
25698
As preliminary studies in vitro demonstrate induction of RelB in PB pDCs after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and CpG, and reduced production of IFN-α by pDCs in RelB-deficient mice, it is likely that RelB activation does accompany pDC activation.
25699
25866
However, RelB translocation might be quantitatively reduced or RelB might be more rapidly degraded in the nucleus of pDCs than of myeloid DCs in inflamed tissues [58].
25869
26183
Of relevance to the RA inflammatory lesion, stimulation of blood pDC precursors with signals including CD154, influenza virus, or CpG oligonucleotides induces production of large amounts of cytokines, including IFN-α, IFN-β, and TNF-α; induction of DC differentiation; and stimulation of APC function [3,39,44,59].
26184
26470
Although inhibitory effects of SF on DC function, and thus on T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, are confirmed here [21,39,60], factors in the RA SF environment, such as IL-3 and CD154, may be sufficient to precondition the SF pDCs for efficient APC function ex vivo [36,44].
26471
26638
IFN-γ, IL-10, and TNF-α were produced in mixed lymphocyte reactions stimulated by myeloid or pDCs derived from SF but not PB, potentially by DCs or by T cells or both.
26639
26863
In the tissue, as a result of antigen presentation by myeloid DCs or pDCs, key effector cytokines may be produced in perivascular areas in RA, located strategically close to endothelial cells, as well as incoming leukocytes.
26864
26982
It is not known whether pDCs are capable, like myeloid DCs, of migration from synovial tissue to draining lymph nodes.
26983
27265
However, it seems probable that pDCs conditioned by local IL-3 and CD154, or even viral or bacterial products transported to the synovium, predominantly play local proinflammatory and antigen-presenting roles, through secretion of cytokines such as IFN-α and possibly TNF-α [61,62].
27268

Conclusion
27280
27418
pDCs are recruited to RA synovial tissue and comprise an APC population distinct from the previously described nuclear RelB+ synovial DCs.
27419
27472
The APC function of pDCs is greater in SF than in PB.
27473
27579
Activated pDCs and interacting T cells may contribute significantly to the inflammatory environment in RA.
