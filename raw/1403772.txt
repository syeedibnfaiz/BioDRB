Abstract
99
201
Background: Notch plays a wide-ranging role in controlling cell fate, differentiation and development.
202
345
The PI3K-Akt pathway is a similarly conserved signalling pathway which regulates processes such as differentiation, proliferation and survival.
346
518
Mice with disrupted Notch and PI3K signalling show phenotypic similarities during haematopoietic cell development, suggesting functional interaction between these pathways.
519
704
Results: We show that cellular responsiveness to Notch signals depends on the activity of the PI3K-Akt pathway in cells as diverse as CHO cells, primary T-cells and hippocampal neurons.
705
895
Induction of the endogenous PI3K-Akt pathway in CHO cells (by the insulin pathway), in T-cells (via TCR activation) or in neurons (via TrKB activation) potentiates Notch-dependent responses.
896
1061
We propose that the PI3K-Akt pathway exerts its influence on Notch primarily via inhibition of GSK3-beta, a kinase known to phosphorylate and regulate Notch signals.
1062
1147
Conclusion: The PI3K-Akt pathway acts as a "gain control" for Notch signal responses.
1148
1304
Since physiological levels of intracellular Notch are often low, coincidence with PI3K-activation may be crucial for induction of Notch-dependent responses.
1306
1316
Background
1318
1554
The phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3Ks) constitute an enzyme family of p85/p110 heterodimers responsible for regulating numerous biological processes in diverse cell types [1] such as cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival.
1555
1725
Of particular interest is the role of this pathway in lymphocyte activation, where antigen and cytokine receptor ligation result in activation of PI3K-driven signals [2].
1726
1826
A key target of PI3K activity is Akt/PKB, which mediates many of the effects of PI3K activation [3].
1829
1967
PI3K is activated in T-cells both in response to T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, and by engagement of the co-stimulatory receptor CD28.
1968
2210
Gene targeting studies have emphasised the essential role PI3K plays in these responses: whereas PI3K-deficient mice are immunodeficient [4,5], constitutive activity is associated with hyperproliferative T-cell responses and autoimmunity [6].
2211
2389
Equally, preventing the termination of PI3K activity by conditional gene targeting of the lipid phosphatase Pten in T-cells leads to autoimmunity and development of lymphoma [7].
2390
2528
These studies demonstrate that PI3K activity is tightly regulated and plays an integral role in the maintenance of lymphocyte homeostasis.
2531
2702
The Notch signalling pathway plays a critical role in a wide range of developmental processes in the embryo, including binary lineage decisions and boundary formation [8].
2703
2962
Binding of the Notch ligands Delta or Jagged to the Notch receptor instigates proteolytic cleavage which releases the Notch intracellular domain (N-IC) [8] which activates the transcription factor CBF-1 which, in turn, controls target genes such as Hes-1 [9].
2963
3115
Central to Notch's role is its ability to modulate the differentiative potential of pluripotent cells, for instance in the neural stem cell compartment.
3116
3247
The effects of Notch also extend to the developing immune system, where it directs the differentiation of lymphoid precursors [10].
3248
3372
Recent data have highlighted unexpected functions for the Notch pathway in regulating cells of the peripheral immune system.
3373
3630
Co-incident delivery of Notch signals to T-cells exerts a profound effect upon the outcome of antigen-stimulation in vitro [11-13] suggesting that interplay between the antigen receptor and Notch pathways regulate the outcome of peripheral T-cell responses.
3633
3908
Mice expressing catalytically inactive PI3K subunit p110δ [5] or a deletion of p110δ [4] exhibit defective B-cell and T-cell receptor signalling: antigen-mediated activation of BCR or TCR fails to activate Akt and cells exhibit defective proliferation and cytokine responses.
3909
4118
Recent publications have demonstrated that Notch signals modulate cytokine production by T-cells [12,13], suggesting that the Notch pathway integrates with TCR-mediated signals to modulate cytokine production.
4119
4240
Furthermore, marginal zone B (MZB) cell development is severely impaired in both p110δ- and Notch2-deficient mice [4,14].
4241
4398
Taken together with Notch's ability to modulate TCR signals, this phenotypic similarity suggested to us the possibility of Notch/PI3K signalling integration.
4399
4618
Our studies reveal that the PI3K-Akt pathway is a potent inducer of Notch-dependent responses in cell types as diverse T-cells and neurons, demonstrating that this is a cell signalling paradigm with broad applicability.

Results
4630
4811
To address whether the PI3K pathway is a regulator of Notch-responsiveness, we generated a Jurkat E6.1 T-cell line which stably expresses full-length human Notch2 cDNA (J-N2 cells).
4812
5062
J-N2 cells were treated with plate-bound recombinant human Delta1 protein (hereafter referred to as Delta1-Fc) fusion protein, and Notch signalling was measured using a transiently-transfected CBF1-driven luciferase reporter construct (p10xCBF1-luc).
5063
5190
Plate-bound recombinant Delta1-Fc efficiently transactivated CBF1-luc, driving around a 10-fold increase in activity (Fig. 1A).
5191
5313
A similar result was obtained using the murine Hes-1 promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter (data not shown).
5314
5465
Strikingly, treatment of these cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 led to a dose-dependent decrease in Delta1-Fc-induced Notch signalling (Fig. 1A).
5466
5573
A similar result was observed with the mechanistically-distinct PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin (data not shown).
5574
5778
The integrity of this reporter assay as an accurate reflection of Notch signalling was confirmed by assessing mRNA levels of the Notch target gene Hes-1 by Q-PCR in Delta1-Fc-treated J-N2 cells (Fig. 1B).
5779
5890
As with the CBF1-dependent reporter, treatment with LY294002 inhibited the up-regulation of Hes-1 by Delta1-Fc.
5893
6031
The lipid phosphatase Pten dephosphorylates the 3' phosphoinositide products of PI3K catalysis and prevents downstream PI3K signaling [1].
6032
6144
Jurkat E6.1 cells are deficient in expression of Pten, and therefore have a highly active PI3K-Akt pathway [15].
6145
6233
We therefore hypothesised that reconstituting this enzyme would reduce Notch signalling.
6234
6389
Transient expression of Pten in J-N2 cells led to a decrease in both basal and Notch ligand-induced activation of CBF1-dependent gene expression (Fig. 1C).
6390
6604
Pten-transfected and control cells showed equivalent CBF1-reporter activity in the presence of LY294002, demonstrating that once PI3K activity is abolished pharmacologically, Pten over-expression becomes redundant.
6607
6701
The PI3K pathway activates several enzymes, including the central signalling molecule Akt/PKB.
6702
6881
To further define the mechanism by which PI3K activity regulates Notch signals, we asked whether the inhibitory effect of LY294002 could be recapitulated with an inhibitor of Akt.
6882
7029
Blocking Akt activity in J-N2 cells with the selective inhibitor SH-6 [16] inhibited Delta1-Fc-mediated upregulation of Notch signalling (Fig. 1D).
7030
7176
Taken together, these data identify the PI3K-Akt pathway as being responsible for the high level of ligand-induced Notch activation in J-N2 cells.
7179
7288
We next investigated whether PI3K activity also regulates Notch-responsiveness in primary human CD4+ T-cells.
7289
7390
We asked whether PI3K induction, triggered by TCR activation, could influence Hes-1 levels (Fig. 2A).
7391
7573
In the absence of any exogenously added Delta 1 (open bars-IgG control), TCR activation (with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies) up-regulated Hes-1 levels in a LY294002-sensitive manner.
7574
7709
Significantly, this induction was also blocked by the gamma secretase inhibitor DAPT, consistent with an absolute requirement for N-IC.
7710
7787
We also studied the induction of Hes-1 by Delta 1-Fc treatment (closed bars).
7788
7884
In the absence of TCR activation, Delta 1-Fc induced a small, but consistent induction of Hes-1.
7885
8042
However, coincidence of Delta 1-Fc with TCR activation (anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies) dramatically up-regulated Hes-1 levels in a LY294002-sensitive manner.
8043
8120
Again, this induction was also blocked by the gamma secretase inhibitor DAPT.
8121
8380
LY294002 also inhibited Notch signalling in primary human CD4+ T-cells transfected with p10xCBF1-luc and a Notch1 intracellular domain expression plasmid (data not shown), demonstrating that the effect of PI3K on Notch is exerted downstream of Notch cleavage.
8381
8536
Thus, TCR activation dramatically increases the cellular response to Notch signals in primary human T cells via a mechanism requiring the PI3K-Akt pathway.
8539
8638
We then tested whether Akt activation is sufficient to boost Notch-responsiveness in human T cells.
8639
8813
Over-expression of a constitutively-active Akt construct (gagAkt [17]) was sufficient to potentiate the ability of pN1-IC to drive CBF1-dependent reporter activity (Fig. 2B).
8816
8981
Previous data has suggested that inactivation of GSK3β by the Wingless pathway enhanced Notch signals by preventing inhibitory phosphorylation of N-IC by GSK3β [18].
8982
9151
Therefore, given that Akt phoshorylates and inactivates GSK3β [19], we hypothesised that Akt-dependent inactivation of GSK3β might be responsible for Notch potentiation.
9152
9304
To address this question, we looked at the N1-IC-induced Notch response in primary human CD4+ T-cells treated with the GSK3β inhibitor lithium chloride.
9305
9397
Increasing concentrations of LiCl induced a dramatic increase in Notch signalling (Fig. 3A).
9400
9561
In contrast to N1-IC overexpression, triggering Notch signalling using recombinant ligand to ligate endogenous full length Notch generates far weaker signalling.
9562
9751
This fact, coupled with limited transfection efficiency of primary T cells, makes it technically difficult to achieve robust induction of a transfected CBF1 reporter construct by Delta1-Fc.
9752
9954
However, given the large potentiation of Notch-responsiveness by LiCl (Fig. 3A), we hypothesised that, in the presence of LiCl, robust Delta1-Fc dependent induction of a CBF1 reporter could be observed.
9955
10127
We found that, consistent with the technical issues outline above, plate-bound Delta1-Fc activates the CBF1 reporter weakly and unreliably in the absence of LiCl (Fig. 3B).
10128
10224
However, LiCl greatly potentiates activation of the reporter by plate-bound Delta1-Fc (Fig. 3B).
10225
10451
Thus, the GSK3β inhibitor LiCl is sufficient to potentiate primary Notch-responsiveness in primary human CD4+ T-cells, triggered either by N1-IC expression, or by ligation of endogenous full length Notch by plate-bound ligand.
10454
10583
In Jurkat T-cells, deficient in Pten expression, basal Akt activity is high [15], so we expected GSK3β to be maximally inhibited.
10584
10712
Consistent with this, LiCl treatment did not exert any further effect on Delta1-induced signalling in Jurkat-N2 cells (Fig. 3C).
10715
10952
To investigate whether PI3K-dependent regulation of Notch responsiveness may be a general phenomenon extending beyond T-cell biology, we took advantage of a Notch-dependent CHO cell reporter assay which we have previously described [20].
10953
11217
In this assay, CHO cells which stably express a human Notch2 receptor cDNA and a CBF1-dependent luciferase reporter construct (termed CHO-N2) are co-cultured with a second CHO cell line which stably expresses the full-length human Delta1 cDNA (termed CHO-hDelta1).
11218
11381
CHO-hDelta1 cells trigger a dose-dependent luciferase response to the CHO-N2 cells, whilst control CHO parental cells fail to activate the Notch pathway (Fig. 4A).
11382
11476
We next asked if activation of the PI3K pathway influenced Notch signals in this assay system.
11477
11666
As predicted from our T-cell studies, including insulin in the culture medium potentiated Notch signalling, and this effect was blocked almost completely by inclusion of LY294002 (Fig. 4B).
11667
11843
From our observations with T-cells, we hypothesisesd that GSK3β inhibition with LiCl could substitute for insulin in potentiating Notch signalling induced by CHO-hDelta1 cells.
11844
12004
LiCl does indeed potentiate Notch signalling in the CHO co-culture system, leading to a substantial enhancement of ligand-dependent reporter activity (Fig. 4C).
12007
12195
We then extended our study further, this time into primary neurons, cell types where Notch plays an emerging role in processes such as dendritic patterning and synaptic plasticity [21,22].
12196
12384
As observed with T-cells, inhibition of GSK3β with lithium chloride strongly enhanced the level of Notch signalling in rat primary hippocampal neurons in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D).
12385
12530
PI3K-activating neurotrophins such as BDNF regulate cell survival, proliferation and differentiation of both peripheral and central neurons [23].
12531
12663
Strikingly, BDNF treatment potentiated pN1-IC-driven reporter activity, and this was abrogated by treatment with LY294002 (Fig. 4D).
12664
12836
Pten transfection ablated both basal and BDNF-stimulated reporter signalling, further underlining the role of the PI3K pathway in promoting Notch-responsiveness in neurons.
12837
12966
Moreover, over-expression of constitutively active gagAkt was sufficient to potentiate pN1-IC-driven reporter activity (Fig. 4E).
12967
13165
To further reinforce this finding, expression of a constitutively-active GSK3β construct (S9A), which is resistant to inactivation by Akt, prevented BDNF induction of Notch responsiveness (Fig. 4E).
13166
13295
In contrast, expression of wild-type GSK3β, which is inhibited by Akt activity, failed to significantly reduce reporter activity.
13296
13449
As observed with T-cells, inhibition of GSK3β with lithium chloride strongly enhanced the level of Notch signalling in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D).
13450
13576
Thus the PI3K-Akt pathway positively regulates Notch signals via GSK3β in neurons as well as T-cells, as summarised in Fig. 5.
13579
13589
Discussion
13591
13744
The dynamic and interactive nature of intracellular communication dictates that cells are in receipt of multiple environmental signals at any given time.
13745
13900
The cellular output must represent a net response to a diverse set of cues, and therefore the pathways mediating these responses are frequently integrated.
13901
14027
Our studies demonstrate for the first time that PI3K activity strongly potentiates Notch responsiveness in diverse cell types.
14028
14173
Given the vital nature of PI3K and Notch in controlling cellular survival and differentiation, the implications of this finding are far-reaching.
14176
14315
Ligation of lymphocyte antigen receptors leads to activation of PI3K, initiating a diverse and wide-ranging set of signalling pathways [2].
14316
14484
Our findings that PI3K activation enhances Notch signalling leads us to suggest that Notch pathway activation might be an inherent consequence of lymphocyte activation.
14485
14589
This positions the Notch pathway as a central mediator of antigen-dependent stimulation of immune cells.
14592
14732
T-cells are entirely quiescent in the absence of antigen signals, but are shifted rapidly into a state of activation following TCR ligation.
14733
14886
Inappropriate control of this activation can lead to autoimmune disease, and therefore negative feedback loops are an inherent feature of T-cell biology.
14887
14976
Recent data show that Notch signals block Akt activation in peripheral CD4+ T-cells [13].
14977
15179
Indeed we also observe that in primary human CD4+ T-cells recombinant Delta1-IgG4 fusion protein, or Notch-IC expression, blocks TCR-mediated phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β (GM, BC, unpublished data).
15180
15474
Although Akt activation is essential for production of cytokines such as IL2 and IFNγ by T-cells [24], constitutive activity is associated with cellular transformation [25], and therefore the existence of a negative feedback loop to limit antigen-dependent Akt activation would appear rational.
15475
15719
We have shown that co-incident Notch signals are enhanced upon TCR activation, and we hypothesise that by inhibiting Akt activity, enhanced Notch signalling may constitute a negative feedback control impacting upon peripheral T-cell activation.
15722
15904
It is interesting to note that whilst the model we propose is consistent with the data generated in peripheral T-cells, a number of studies suggest that the opposite is true [26-28].
15905
16181
Ciofani et al demonstrate that during the earliest stages of T-cell development in the thymus Notch signals co-operate with pre-TCR signalling to activate Akt-dependent metabolism, thereby promoting expansion of those T-cells which have undergone favourable TCR rearrangement.
16182
16436
The functional outcome of PI3K/Notch pathway interaction thus appears to reverse from developing to mature T-cells, an observation which further underlines the ability of the Notch pathway to perform multiple, context-dependent, tasks during development.
16437
16574
We suggest that a molecular understanding of how Notch can function as a bi-directional regulator of Akt activity is a research priority.
16577
16740
Our data strongly suggests that PI3K activity links to the Notch signalling pathway through Akt-mediated inactivation of GSK3β, a known downstream effector of Akt.
16741
16878
In support of this data, PI3K and GSK3β [18,28,29] have both been identified as binding partners for N-IC in immunoprecipitation studies.
16879
17020
GSK3β has also previously been positioned as a component of the downstream Notch signalling pathway in lateral inhibition in Drosophila [30].
17021
17215
Furthermore, GSK3β activity is inhibited downstream of both the wingless and PI3K pathways, and thus represents a convergent site for integration of extracellular signals with the Notch pathway.
17216
17378
Indeed, inhibiting GSK3β activity by activating the wingless pathway with Wnt-1 has been shown to enhance Notch-dependent reporter activity in NIH-3T3 cells [18].
17379
17570
We note, however, that although an interaction between GSK3β and Notch seems conclusively proven, the functional consequences of this interaction are not consistent between different studies.
17571
17861
Whilst our data agrees with that of Espinosa et al. [18], that is that GSK3β activity inhibits Notch signalling, data from the Nye laboratory in GSK3β-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts demonstrates that GSK3β phosphorylates and stabilises Notch-IC, leading to enhanced signalling [29].
17862
18083
Although we have no definitive explanation for these experimental differences, it is possible that, as discussed above for thymocytes and T-cells, the effect of GSK3b on Notch changes between embryonic and mature tissues.
18086
18289
Notch's role during embryonic development is not to directly program neuronal differentiation itself, but to inhibit this cell fate choice in neighbouring cells during the lateral inhibition process [8].
18290
18424
During neurogenesis, this is achieved by Notch target genes blocking transcription of pro-neural transcription factors such as MASH-1.
18425
18668
Interestingly, conditional deletion of Pten in neural progenitors leads to dramatic alterations in brain architecture, an observation which the authors attribute to increased proliferation and self-renewal of neural stem cell populations [31].
18669
18855
Given that the data presented here establishes the Notch-suppressing capability of Pten, deregulated renewal of progenitors in these mice may be in part due to enhanced Notch signalling.
18856
18887
This hypothesis awaits testing.
18890
18990
Notch also plays an emerging role in differentiating neurons by inhibiting dendritic outgrowth [21].
18991
19179
It is tempting to speculate that Notch-dependent dendritic retraction, reliant on neuron-neuron interactions, is augmented by target-derived neurotrophic factors promoting PI3K signalling.
19180
19277
In differentiated neurons, Notch contributes to synaptic plasticity, learning and memory [22,32].
19278
19447
The long-standing involvement of BDNF and other neurotrophins in synaptic plasticity raise the possibility that PI3K-Notch interplay is at work in this scenario as well.
19450
19460
Conclusion
19462
19723
Our data demonstrates that the potentiation of Notch signalling by PI3K is conserved in ontologically-distinct cell types, leading us to suggest that it represents a general mechanism of signal integration linking two evolutionarily-conserved pathways together.
19724
19875
This apparently simple observation has far-reaching implications regarding the mechanisms by which stem cell self-renewal and differentiation proceeds.
19876
20037
It will be interesting to assess the relevance of this finding in other signalling contexts, such as tumour formation, where Notch and PI3K have important roles.
