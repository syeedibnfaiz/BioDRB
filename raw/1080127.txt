Analysis of the CCR3 promoter reveals a regulatory region in exon 1 that binds GATA-1
87
95
Abstract
97
266
Background: CC Chemokine Receptor 3 (CCR3), the major chemokine receptor expressed on eosinophils, binds promiscuously to several ligands including eotaxins 1, 2, and 3.
267
465
Even though the only cells that consistently accumulate following eotaxin administration in vivo are myeloid cells (primarily eosinophils), other cell types have recently been shown to express CCR3.
466
561
It is therefore important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating receptor expression.
562
835
Results: In order to define regions responsible for CCR3 transcription, a DNAse hypersensitive site was identified in the vicinity of exon 1. Coupled with our previous data implicating exon 1 in CCR3 transcription, we hypothesized that transcription factors bind to exon-1.
836
945
Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed that nuclear proteins in eosinophilic cells bound to exon 1.
946
1040
Furthermore, antibody interference and mutation studies demonstrated GATA-1 binding to exon 1.
1041
1068
In order to test the 1.6-kb
1069
1219
CCR3 promoter element (that includes exon 1) for in vivo function, this region was used to generate transgenic mice that expressed a reporter protein.
1220
1328
Strong transgene expression was achieved, with the pattern of expression suggesting a broad acting promoter.
1329
1394
Conclusion: The transcription factor GATA-1 binds to CCR3 exon 1.
1395
1405
The 1.6-kb
1406
1480
CCR3 promoter element, that includes exon 1, is a strong promoter in vivo.
1482
1492
Background
1494
1636
CCR3, the eotaxin receptor, is the major chemokine receptor expressed on eosinophils, basophils and a subpopulation of Th2 lymphocytes [1-10].
1637
1832
Recently, CCR3 has been shown to be upregulated on neutrophils and monocytoid U937 cells by interferons in vitro and to be expressed by endothelial cells, epithelial cells and mast cells [11-16].
1833
2073
The relevance of these findings and the function of CCR3 on non-leukocytes remain to be elucidated since the only cells that consistently accumulate following eotaxin administration in vivo are myeloid cells (primarily eosinophils) [17-20].
2076
2203
To date, the complete mRNA and genomic organization of only a limited number of chemokine receptors has been described [21-26].
2204
2332
These studies have shown that the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) can be complex and contain up to 11 exons as in the CXCR2 gene.
2333
2456
As a result, alternative splicing and transcription directed by multiple promoters can give rise to variable mRNA isoforms.
2457
2619
The function of these 5' untranslated exons has not been examined except for a single study focused on CCR2, demonstrating a transcriptional role for exon 1 [24].
2620
2725
We have previously characterized the genomic structure and promoter function of the human CCR3 gene [27].
2726
2830
The CCR3 gene contains at least 4 exons that give rise to multiple mRNA species by alternative splicing.
2831
2977
The first 1.6 kb of the 5' flanking region of exon 1 had strong promoter activity in eosinophilic, lymphoid and respiratory epithelial cell lines.
2978
3145
Deletion analysis revealed differential regulation of the CCR3 promoter in eosinophilic and epithelial cell lines suggesting the presence of lineage-specific elements.
3146
3206
Interestingly, exon 1 enhanced the activity of the promoter.
3207
3410
Since our initial characterization, two other groups have studied the CCR3 promoter [28,29]; however, their studies focused on lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines, respectively, rather than eosinophils.
3411
3517
Scotet et al. [29] demonstrated that the human CCR3 promoter is active in vitro in lymphocytic cell lines.
3518
3622
They also demonstrate a role for chromatin remodeling in the regulation of CCR3 expression in Th2 cells.
3623
3865
Vijh et al. [28] demonstrated that the human CCR3 promoter is active in monocytic cell lines and defined the minimal promoter that consists of a downstream promoter element (DPE), a common element in Drosophila genes, but rare in human genes.
3866
3952
This element is upstream (50 bp) of the exon 1 sequence studied in the current report.
3955
4086
It has been reported that 5' untranslated exons, and sometimes introns, can regulate the expression of genes in two different ways.
4087
4165
An untranslated sequence can act as a tissue-specific translational regulator.
4166
4342
A striking example is the gonadotropin releasing hormone gene which is transcribed in multiple tissue, but cannot be translated due to the lack of specific intron removal [30].
4343
4424
Alternatively, untranslated regions (UTR) can facilitate transcription of a gene.
4425
4575
Examples include a GATA-1 site in the 5'-UTR of the γ-globin gene, an HNF-1 site in the plasminogen gene and a C/EBP site in the CCR2 gene [24,31,32].
4576
4793
While the mechanism of action is not completely clear, it is thought that transcription factors binding to untranslated regions affect transcription of the gene through interactions with the RNA transcription complex.
4794
4863
The role of untranslated exons in the CCR3 gene has not been studied.
4864
4991
In this report, DNase I hypersensitivity identified a major hypersensitive site located in the vicinity of untranslated exon 1.
4992
5165
Furthermore, the transcription factor GATA-1 is shown to bind to untranslated exon 1, suggesting a potential mechanism for the regulation of CCR3 transcription by this exon.
5166
5311
Finally, using a transgenic approach, we demonstrate that the 1.6 kb 5' flanking region of CCR3 (including exon 1) has promoter activity in vivo.
5314
5321
Results
5323
5400
We aimed to define regulatory regions in the CCR3 gene by a gene-wide search.
5401
5482
Thus, we performed DNase I hypersensitivity of CCR3 in primary human eosinophils.
5483
5647
The entire 24 kb of the CCR3 gene were screened for DNase I hypersensitivity using probes specific for Eco RI and Hind III fragments (Figure 1A and data not shown).
5648
5731
Only one hypersensitive site was noted; this was in the area of exon 1 (Figure 1B).
5732
5806
Similar results were obtained with nuclei from the eosinophilic AML14.3D10
5807
5834
cell line (data not shown).
5835
5996
This cell line does not express CCR3 unless induced with butyric acid and IL-5; suggesting that chromatin remodeling in the HS1 site precedes CCR3 transcription.
5997
6154
Thus, our analysis revealed areas of active chromatin remodeling in the vicinity of exon 1 suggesting that this area may be important for CCR3 transcription.
6157
6261
DNase I hypersensitivity indicated that a region consistent with exon 1 is active in CCR3 transcription.
6262
6478
Together with our previous data showing that untranslated exon 1 has an important role in CCR3 transcription [27], we hypothesized that nuclear proteins bind to exon 1, and in turn regulate the transcription of CCR3.
6479
6672
In order to test this hypothesis, a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe that corresponds to bp +10 to +60 of the CCR3 gene was prepared, referred to as E1-FL (exon 1- full length, Figure 2A).
6673
6741
This is the exact sequence that was deleted in the CCR3(-exon1).pGL3
6742
6837
plasmid that demonstrated decreased activity compared to the full length 1.6 kb construct [27].
6838
6944
Nuclear extracts from AML14.3D10 cells were incubated with the probe and resolved on a polyacrylamide gel.
6945
6980
Two bands were visible (Figure 2B).
6981
7135
The upper band was eliminated when 150x molar excess of the unlabelled probe was used (CC: E1-FL in Figure 2B), indicating that this is the specific band.
7136
7345
In order to precisely localize the region responsible for factor binding, overlapping cold competitors were used: E1-A spanning from +10 to +31, E1-B spanning from +25 to +46 and E1-C spanning from +40 to +60.
7346
7494
The specific band was eliminated with E1-B and E1-C cold competitors indicating that the factor binds in the region between +25 and +60 (Figure 2B).
7495
7632
In summary, these data indicate the presence of proteins in the nuclei of AML14.3D10 cells that bind to CCR3 exon 1 between bp 25 and 60.
7635
7780
In order to define the proteins capable of binding to CCR3 exon 1, the exon 1 sequence was analyzed using the publicly available TFSEARCH engine.
7781
7909
This analysis indicated the presence of consensus DNA-binding sites in the exon 1 region for several transcription factors (i.e.
7910
7936
GATA, AML1, SRY, S8 etc.).
7937
8059
Proteins of the GATA family have been detected in eosinophils (specifically GATA-1, GATA-2 and low levels of GATA-3) [33].
8060
8182
Additionally, GATA-1 transactivates the EOS47 promoter, an eosinophil-specific promoter, through a site in the 5'UTR [34].
8183
8267
Therefore, we hypothesized that proteins of the GATA family bind to sites in exon 1.
8268
8424
In order to address the binding of GATA proteins to CCR3 exon 1, we prepared oligonucleotides corresponding to probe E1-B and -C with the GATA site mutated.
8425
8631
As demonstrated in Figure 3A, when used as cold competitor, the GATA mutant oligonucleotide was not capable of interfering with the binding of nuclear factors to either CCR3 exon 1 probe E1-B or probe E1-C.
8632
8724
Additionally, we used a GATA consensus oligonucleotide with binding sites for GATA proteins.
8725
8847
This oligonucleotide completely abolished binding of nuclear factors to both CCR3 exon 1 probes E1-B and E1-C (Figure 3A).
8848
8939
Together, these data indicate that GATA proteins, present in nuclear extracts of AML14.3D10
8940
8994
cells, are capable of binding to CCR3 exon 1 sequence.
8997
9219
In order to delineate which GATA factors are binding to exon 1, nuclear extracts from AML14.3D10 cells were incubated with the radiolabelled full-length CCR3 exon 1 probe in the presence or absence of anti-GATA-1 antibody.
9220
9376
As seen in Figure 3B, the GATA-1 antibody was able to interfere with the binding of the protein factor from the nuclear extracts to the radiolabelled probe.
9377
9630
In order to more precisely localize to which part of exon 1 GATA-1 is capable of binding, overlapping oligonucleotide probes were radiolabelled and incubated with nuclear extracts from AML14.3D10 cells in the presence and absence of the GATA-1 antibody.
9631
9736
This treatment efficiently inhibited the binding of probes E1-B and -C to the nuclear factor (Figure 3C).
9737
9811
These data indicate that GATA-1, present in nuclear extracts of AML14.3D10
9812
9906
cells, is at least one of the factors capable of binding the CCR3 exon 1 between bp 25 and 60.
9909
9980
We have previously characterized the human CCR3 promoter in vitro [27].
9981
10194
In order to determine if this region had promoter activity in vivo and to assess cell-specificity, we generated transgenic mice expressing the reporter gene EGFP under the control of the CCR3 promoter (Figure 4A).
10195
10284
1.6 kb of the promoter and 60 base pairs of exon 1 were cloned upstream of the EGFP gene.
10285
10332
Seven transgenic founder lines were identified.
10333
10518
Two of the founder lines did not transmit the transgene to their offspring and one line did not show transgene expression as determined by Northern blotting and RT-PCR (data not shown).
10519
10629
In four of the lines the level and pattern of transgene expression varied suggesting integration site effects.
10630
10725
Two of the lines (4.1 and 4.2) displayed minimal mRNA expression and were not further analyzed.
10726
10833
In contrast, the other two lines (3.1 and 3.2) showed high expression of the transgene in multiple tissues.
10834
11071
Line 3.1 displayed varying levels of mRNA expression in all organs tested: lungs, kidneys, jejunum, thymus, bone marrow, and spleen, with highest expression in the thymus (by Northern blot analysis, Figure 4B and RT-PCR, data not shown).
11072
11179
While we expected the transcript to be about 1 kb in size (Figure 4A), two bands ~4 and 5 kb were apparent.
11180
11330
Since this was not the case with other lines, we suspect it is integration-site specific and another gene may have been transcribed together with GFP.
11331
11590
However, the size of the RT-PCR amplified fragment was of the expected size and the protein was detectable by immunohistochemistry (see below) thus implying that this did not affect the translation of the protein and integrity of the epitope for the antibody.
11591
11721
Expression in the lungs, jejunum, thymus and kidney was confirmed by anti-GFP immunohistochemistry (Figure 4C and data not shown).
11722
11802
In the jejunum, staining was present predominantly in stromal cells (Figure 4C).
11803
11915
Of note, eosinophils normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract and are located in the stroma of the jejunum.
11916
12132
However, in the lungs, which are normally devoid of eosinophils at baseline, there was GFP expression that was confined to the alveolar lining consistent with predominant expression in type I pneumocytes (Figure 4C).
12133
12252
In the thymus, compared to staining without primary antibody (data not shown), all thymocytes stained positive for GFP.
12253
12354
Additionally, in the kidney all cells were positive, both in the medulla and cortex (data not shown).
12355
12418
Line 3.2 displayed a different pattern of transgene expression.
12419
12550
Northern blot analysis revealed expression in multiple organs with the lungs and kidneys expressing the highest levels (Figure 4B).
12551
12720
Consistent with this, protein was detected by immunohistochemistry at high levels in lungs and kidneys and only marginally in the jejunum (Figure 4C and data not shown).
12721
12862
While staining in the lungs was comparable to line 3.1, only a minority of stromal cells and no epithelial cells were stained in the jejunum.
12863
12995
In the kidney, almost all cells expressed the transgene in the medulla, while in the cortex staining was prominent in the glomeruli.
12996
13066
There was no anti-GFP staining observed in wild type mice (Figure 4C).
13067
13181
No changes in expression were found when the transgene was crossed with CD2.IL-5 transgenic mice (data not shown).
13182
13285
In summary, the 1.6 kb of the 5' flanking region of the CCR3 gene has strong promoter activity in vivo.
13286
13389
However, both the level and pattern of expression vary between founder lines and lack cell specificity.
13390
13524
Thus, the identified region of the CCR3 promoter contains a broadly active promoter with hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic activity.
13527
13537
Discussion
13539
13644
In this report, DNase I hypersensitivity implicated untranslated exon 1 in regulating CCR3 transcription.
13645
13767
Furthermore, nuclear proteins derived from eosinophilic cells were shown to bind CCR3 exon between nucleotides +25 to +60.
13768
13897
Using unlabelled competitors and antibodies, proteins of the GATA family, specifically GATA-1, were shown to bind to this region.
13898
14015
Taken together, these data suggest that untranslated exon 1, via GATA-1, has a regulatory role in CCR3 transcription.
14016
14055
Finally, we demonstrate that the 1.6-kb
14056
14127
CCR3 promoter element, that includes exon 1, is broadly active in vivo.
14130
14181
The HS1 site was located in the vicinity of exon 1.
14182
14392
Combined with our previous results demonstrating diminished promoter activity when exon 1 is deleted from the promoter construct, these data suggested that 5' untranslated exon 1 may have a regulatory function.
14393
14509
It has been reported that the 5' untranslated exons may contain sequences that facilitate transcription of the gene.
14510
14693
Examples include a GATA-1 site in the 5'-UTR of the γ-globin gene, an HNF-1 site in the plasminogen gene, a PU.1 site in the PU.1 gene and a C/EBP site in the CCR2 gene [24,31,32,35].
14694
14753
Thus, we hypothesized that nuclear proteins bind to exon 1.
14754
14916
Our EMSA analysis, coupled with cold competitors and specific antibodies, indicates that proteins of the GATA family, specifically GATA-1 bind to the CCR3 exon 1.
14917
14980
Thus, GATA-1 binding to exon 1 may regulate CCR3 transcription.
14981
15096
Alternatively, GATA-1 binding to exon 1 may affect transcription start site function, RNA stability or translation.
15097
15153
These possibilities will be addressed in future studies.
15156
15329
It is important that this data be viewed with what is known about other myeloid-specific promoters, that have often proven to be difficult to function independently in vivo.
15330
15543
For example, constructs using the 5' flanking region of myeloid-specific genes have not been useful for transgenic work (such as the CD14 promoter [36], the c-kit promoter [37], or the 1.7 kb CD11b promoter [38]).
15544
15728
Better success was obtained when the entire gene, including the open reading frame, was used (e.g. the human cathepsin G, chicken lysozyme and c-fps/fes transgenic constructs [39-41]).
15729
15855
These constructs were at least 6 kb in size and contained all exons and introns and several kb of 5' and 3' flanking sequence.
15856
16030
Presumably, these larger constructs contained the locus control region (LCR)- sequences that have the ability to dominantly control gene expression in any chromosomal region.
16031
16207
This in turn allows for a high degree of consistency among independent mouse lines with regard to cell specificity, level of expression and proportionality to gene copy number.
16208
16422
These regions may be located at several different sites in the gene, including introns and coding exons; thus, screening with DNase I hypersensitivity is usually the first method employed to identify these regions.
16423
16626
Transgenic mice expressing the EGFP reporter gene under the control of the CCR3 promoter demonstrate that the 1.6 kb promoter and 60 bp of exon 1 of the CCR3 gene confer strong promoter activity in vivo.
16627
16763
However, these sequences do not contain the entire LCR, since expression of the reporter gene was variable among multiple founder lines.
16764
16850
DNase I hypersensitivity studies discovered one hypersensitive site in the CCR3 locus.
16851
16989
The HS1 site was apparently not sufficient for integration-site independent effects, since it is contained in the promoter construct used.
16990
17060
Thus, future studies will need to broaden the search for the CCR3 LCR.
17061
17153
It is important to note that the true cellular specificity of CCR3 has not been established.
17154
17421
While this gene product is often considered to be specific for inflammatory cells involved in allergic inflammation (eosinophils, mast cells, and possibly Th2 cells), several reports have documented expression by other cell types including additional leukocytes (e.g.
17422
17510
dendritic cells), as well as tissue cells (epithelial and endothelial cells) [11-16,42].
17511
17654
Thus, it remains to be determined if our observation that the CCR3 promoter has broad activity in vivo represents the true endogenous activity.
17657
17872
Since CCR3 is expressed strongly on eosinophils, analysis of the signals that induce its expression may give insight into the molecular mechanisms for the commitment of myeloid progenitors to the eosinophil lineage.
17873
18128
It is generally believed that transcription factors are the final common pathway driving differentiation and that hematopoietic commitment to different lineages is driven by alternative expression of specific combinations of transcription factors [43,44].
18129
18295
Although no eosinophil-specific transcription factors have been reported, eosinophil commitment appears to be regulated by GATA-1, PU-1 and C/EBP proteins [34,45-48].
18296
18549
Consistent with this, DNA binding sites for these transcription factors are found in several eosinophil-selective promoters, such as the promoter for major basic protein (MBP), IL-5 receptor alpha (IL-5Rα) chain and Charcot-Leyden crystal (CLC) protein.
18550
18716
Specifically, ectopic overexpression of GATA-1 in chicken myeloblasts leads to transdifferentiation into eosinophils or thromboblasts depending on the dose used [47].
18717
18902
GATA-1 transactivates several eosinophil-selective promoters [48] including the avian EOS47 promoter in which the GATA-1 site is located downstream of the transcription start site [34].
18905
18915
Conclusion
18917
19253
In summary, in this report we have demonstrated that: 1) DNase I hypersensitivity studies implicate untranslated exon 1 in CCR3 transcription; 2) proteins of the GATA family, specifically GATA-1, bind to untranslated exon 1 in the CCR3 gene; and 3) the 1.6 kb 5' flanking region of the CCR3 gene is broadly active as a promoter in vivo.

Methods
19265
19633
The AML14.3D10 cell line (kindly provided by C.C. Paul, Dayton VA Medical Center, Dayton, OH) [49,50] was grown in RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco BRL), 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (Gibco BRL), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma), and penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco BRL).
19634
19783
Eosinophils were isolated by anti-CD16 negative selection from granulocyte preparations of healthy or atopic volunteers as described previously [51].
19786
19913
Nuclei were derived from cell lines and primary cells using a polyamine buffer containing 0.34 M sucrose, 13.3 mM Tris (pH7.5),
19914
20112
53.2 mM KCl, 13.3 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.133 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.1% TritonX-100, 2 mM MgCl2 and freshly prepared 2-mercaptoethanol and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).
20113
20305
Nuclei were then centrifuged at 2300 g for 30 min over a cushion of 1.2 M sucrose and washed twice prior to resuspension in DNase I digestion buffer (60 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 15 mM Tris (pH7.5),
20306
20347
0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM DTT and 5% glycerol).
20348
20542
Nuclei were resuspended at a concentration of 2–4 × 106 nuclei/ml and gentle DNase I digestion was carried out in a volume of 0.2 ml with 0 to 100 units of DNase I (Roche) for 5 minutes at 30°C.
20543
20665
Following DNase I treatment, nuclei were lysed and DNA purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.
20666
20784
DNA was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes (Eco RI and Hind III) and electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel.
20785
20878
Following transfer to nylon membranes, hybridization was performed using standard procedures.
20879
21067
Probe fragments were made by PCR from genomic DNA. Figure 1 depicts the CCR3 gene structure and restriction fragments and their corresponding probes that were used to span the entire gene.
21070
21160
Cultured cells were washed twice with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Gibco BRL).
21161
21457
2.5 × 106 cells were lysed in lysis buffer [100 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5 mM PMSF], briefly vortexed at a moderate speed, then incubated on ice for 5 minutes.
21458
21704
Sample was centrifuged and the pellet was next resuspended in 20 μl of extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM PMSF), mildly vortexed, and incubated on ice for 15 minutes.
21705
21759
Samples were centrifuged to pellet the nuclear debris.
21760
21863
Supernatants were placed in silicon coated microcentrifuge tubes and stored at -80°C until further use.
21866
22036
Single-stranded oligonucleotides based on the sequence of untranslated exon 1 of the CCR3 promoter were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA).
22037
22284
One full length 51 base pair (+10 to +60) oligonucleotide (GGTACCACTGGTCTTCTTGTGCTTATCCGGGCAAGAACTTATCGAAATACA) and three overlapping oligonucleotides (+10 to +31, +25 to +46, and +40 to +60) and their reverse complements were produced (Figure 2).
22285
22369
Two of the overlapping fragments contained putative GATA binding sites (underlined).
22370
22464
Two mutants and their complements were also made which changed the GATA sequence TATC to TTGA.
22465
22677
This mutation does not change the GC content of the oligonucleotides, nor does it create a new transcription factor site for any of the transcription factors represented in the publicly available TFSEARCH engine.
