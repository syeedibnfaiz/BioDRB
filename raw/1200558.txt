Abstract
133
430
Background: Exposure to Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB), a bacterial superantigen secreted by the Gram-positive bacteria Staphyloccocus aureus, results in the expansion and eventual clonal deletion and anergy of Vβ8+ T cells, as well as massive cytokine release, including Interleukin-2 (IL-2).
431
570
This IL-2 is rapidly secreted following exposure to SEB and may contribute to the symptoms seen following exposure to this bacterial toxin.
571
771
The Tec family kinase ITK has been shown to be important for the production of IL-2 by T cells stimulated in vitro and may represent a good target for blocking the production of this cytokine in vivo.
772
893
In order to determine if ITK represents such a target, mice lacking ITK were analyzed for their response to SEB exposure.
894
1052
Results: It was found that T cells from mice lacking ITK exhibited significantly reduced proliferative responses to SEB exposure in vitro, as well as in vivo.
1053
1194
Examination of IL-2 production revealed that ITK null mice produced reduced levels of this cytokine in vitro, and more dramatically, in vivo.
1195
1470
In vivo analysis of c-jun phosphorylation, previously shown to be critical for regulating IL-2 production, revealed that this pathway was specifically activated in SEB reactive Vβ8+ (but not non-reactive Vβ6+) T cells from WT mice, but not in Vβ8+ T cells from ITK null mice.
1471
1582
However, toxicity analysis indicated that both WT and ITK null animals were similarly affected by SEB exposure.
1583
1773
Conclusion: These data show that ITK is required for IL-2 production induced by SEB in vivo, and may regulate signals leading IL-2 production, in part by regulating phosphorylation of c-jun.
1774
1919
The data also suggest that perturbing T cell activation pathways leading to IL-2 does not necessarily lead to improved responses to SEB toxicity.

Background
1933
2135
Superantigens (SAGs) are microbial toxins of bacterial and viral origin with the ability to activate 5–20% of the T cell population, causing T cell activation, cytokine release and systemic shock [1,2].
2136
2366
Most SAGs share the ability to simultaneously bind the class II major histocompatibility complex molecules and the variable region of the T cell receptor β-chain, without the need to be processed by antigen presenting cells [1,2].
2367
2488
Thus SEB can interact directly with MHC class II molecules on APCs and activate T cells bearing the proper TcR Vβ chains.
2489
2600
The result of this interaction is large-scale stimulation of any T cell that expresses the proper TCR Vβ chain.
2601
2859
A number of studies have shown that when mice are challenged with a SAG such as Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB), toxicity results from massive induction of cytokines derived from T-helper-type-1 (TH1) type cells such as IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α and TNF-β [1,3].
2860
3023
This cytokine production is accompanied by expansion of the numbers of SEB reactive T cells, followed by cell death and the induction of functional "anergy" [4-6].
3026
3152
In order for a T cell to be activated antigen presenting cells (APC) must present antigen, either an antigenic peptide or SAG.
3153
3387
In vitro, this interaction with the TcR has been shown to lead to the activation of a number of tyrosine kinases, including the Src family kinase Lck, the Syk family kinase Zap-70 and the Tec family kinase ITK (for review see [7-10]).
3388
3574
This then results in the activation of a number of signaling pathways including members of the MAPK family of kinases, ERK, JNK and p38, followed by transcription factor activation [10].
3575
3691
In vivo, activation of these T cells lead to the induction of cytokine secretion within hours of SEB exposure [1,3].
3694
3765
ITK is expressed primarily in T cells, NK cells and mast cells [11-13].
3766
3846
In T cells, it is rapidly activated following TcR crosslinking in vitro [14,15].
3847
4043
Mice lacking ITK exhibit reduced proliferation and IL-2 production in vitro, and reduced T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo, with TH2 cell differentiation preferentially affected [15-19].
4044
4188
The observed reduced proliferation of ITK null T cells in vitro is IL-2 dependent as it could be rescued by the addition of exogenous IL-2 [20].
4189
4314
However, these animals are not entirely immunocompromised, with residual responses against LCM, Vaccinia and VS viruses [21].
4315
4398
We have tested whether ITK null mice are susceptible to SEB induced IL-2 secretion.
4399
4529
We show here that mice lacking ITK have much reduced IL-2 production and T cell expansion in response to SEB in vitro and in vivo.
4530
4713
We also show that SEB induced the activation of the JNK MAPK pathway in responding T cells in vivo, and that ITK null T cells were defective in the activation of this pathway in vivo.
4714
4825
However, toxicity analysis indicated that both WT and ITK null animals were similarly affected by SEB exposure.
4826
4989
Our data suggest that ITK is required for full IL-2 secretion following SEB exposure, and that this may be due to the regulation of the JNK pathway by ITK in vivo.
4990
5099
However, reducing T cell signals does not necessarily lead to better physiological responses to SEB exposure.

Results
5111
5275
It has previously been reported that T cells from mice lacking ITK exhibit much reduced proliferation in response to anti-CD3 or TcR antibodies in vitro [15,16,18].
5276
5417
By contrast, these T cells did not have any defects and actually had higher proliferative responses following anti-CD28/PMA stimulation [20].
5418
5637
These data do not provide clear answers as to whether ITK would present a good target for inhibition of SEB induced T cell activation in vivo, and in particular, in the cytokine response observed following SAG exposure.
5638
5748
We therefore first tested whether ITK null T cells could respond to SEB stimulation by proliferation in vitro.
5749
6001
Pooled splenocytes and lymph node cells from WT or ITK null animals were cultured in vitro in the presence of varying concentrations of SEB (5 μg/ml, 0.5 μg/ml, 0.05 μg/ml, 0.005 μg/ml, and 0.0005 μg/ml), and proliferation analyzed over a 5-day period.
6002
6166
We found that WT cells responded normally by proliferating between days 2 and 3, with maximum proliferation observed at day 5 and the 5 μg/ml dose of SEB (Fig. 1a).
6167
6283
Analysis of the dose response at 5 days indicated that the WT cells responded in a dose dependent fashion (Fig. 1b).
6284
6410
By contrast, cells from ITK mice showed very little response, regardless of the dose of SEB used for stimulation (Fig. 1a, b).
6411
6515
We next determined if the same results would be obtained in purified T cell populations from these mice.
6516
6630
T cells were purified from WT and ITK null mice, and stimulated with varying dose of SEB, in the presence of APCs.
6631
6825
Analysis of the data over the 5 days indicated that in the presence of the highest concentration of SEB tested (10 μg/ml), WT T cells responded more robustly than ITK null T cells (see Fig. 1c).
6826
7072
Indeed, at all the doses tested, our analysis indicated that ITK null T cells responded less than WT T cells on day 3, 4 and 5 (Fig. 1d–f), while proliferation was equivalent when PMA and Ionomycin was used to bypass TcR signals (data not shown).
7073
7182
These data indicate that ITK null T cells have significantly reduced proliferative responses to SEB in vitro.
7185
7255
Interleukin-2 is one of the cytokines induced by exposure to SEB [22].
7256
7405
ITK has been shown to regulate IL-2 secretion in vitro by T cells stimulated anti-CD3/TcR antibodies or in response to peptide antigen [15,18,23,24].
7406
7524
We therefore determined the levels of IL-2 in supernatants from cells similarly stimulated with SEB in vitro (Fig. 2).
7525
7870
While WT T cells responded to SEB by secretion of IL-2 within 24 hrs. of stimulation in a dose dependent manner (see Fig. 2a for 5 μg/ml dose), starting at the 0.5 μg/ml SEB concentration (Fig. 2bi), ITK null T cells made very little IL-2, and the small amount of IL-2 that was made was only at the highest concentration of SEB tested (5 μg/ml).
7871
7967
ITK null T cells consistently secreted less IL-2 over the 5-day period and dose range (Fig. 2b).
7968
8141
These data indicate that as previously reported for TcR or antigenic stimulation, ITK regulates the production of IL-2 in vitro in response to SEB stimulation [15,18,23,24].
8144
8393
While these data indicate that ITK regulates T cell proliferation in response to SEB in vitro, it is possible that within the context of antigen presentation and optimal co-stimulatory signals in vivo, ITK null T cells may exhibit a better response.
8394
8532
Exposure of animals to SEB results in an expansion of the SEB reactive T cell population with a peak of around 2 days post exposure [2,4].
8533
8856
In order to determine if the reduced proliferative responses seen with the ITK null T cells in vitro was also seen in vivo, we exposed WT and ITK null animals to SEB and determined the percentages of Vβ8 and Vβ6 positive cells in the CD4+ population by flow cytometry after 2, 4 and 5 days as a measure of T cell expansion.
8857
9016
T cells bearing Vβ8 TcR chains are responsive to SEB stimulation while those that bear Vβ6 TcR chains are not, so we analyzed these two populations of T cells.
9017
9289
As previously reported, in WT animals, we observed an approximately 4 fold expansion in Vβ8 CD4+ T cells in spleen and lymph nodes following SEB exposure (as compared to exposure to PBS, fig 3a,b), while Vβ6 CD4+ T cell populations were largely unchanged (data not shown).
9290
9611
By contrast, there was statistically significantly less expansion of ITK null Vβ8+CD4+ T cells following SEB exposure, although these cells still expanded (Fig. 3a,b) As previously reported, the percentages of T cells bearing Vβ6 did not change over this period in either the WT or ITK null mice (data not shown and [4]).
9612
9699
Thus the absence of ITK results in reduced T cell expansion in vivo in response to SEB.
9702
9832
T cells from ITK null mice proliferate less in vitro and in vivo, and secrete significantly less IL-2 in vitro in response to SEB.
9833
9928
We therefore determined if they would also secrete less IL-2 following SEB stimulation in vivo.
9929
10051
Groups of mice were exposed to SEB i.v. and at various time points their serum was taken and analyzed for IL-2 production.
10052
10212
We found that in comparison to in vitro IL-2 production, when WT mice were exposed to SEB in vivo they produced IL-2 within 1 hr., which peaked at around 2 hrs.
10213
10222
(Fig. 4).
10223
10365
In addition, consistent with the in vitro stimulation, ITK deficient mice secrete significantly less IL-2 in response to SEB in vivo (Fig. 4).
10366
10639
Based on these data we conclude that in vivo IL-2 production occurs earlier than observed in vitro, and that ITK null T cells continue to exhibit defects in IL-2 production in response to SEB in vivo, even in the presumed presence of adequate costimulatory signals in vivo.
10642
10779
The JNK MAPK pathway has been shown to be essential for IL-2 production upon stimulation of T cells by the TcR and CD28 in vitro [25-28].
10780
10927
This pathway leads to phosphorylation of c-jun and activation of an AP-1 transcription factor complex that is required for IL-2 transcription [28].
10928
11220
While activation of the JNK pathway leading to phosphorylation and activation of c-jun has been demonstrated in T cells following TcR and CD28 crosslinking in vitro, as well as by peptide antigen stimulation in vivo, it is not clear whether the SAG SEB activates this pathway in vivo [29,30].
11221
11333
We therefore tested whether SEB could induce phosphorylation of c-jun in WT T cells stimulated with SEB in vivo.
11334
11481
To do this, we adapted a method initially used by Jenkins and colleagues to analyze phosphorylation of c-jun following in vivo exposure of antigen.
11482
11685
In this protocol, mice were exposed to SEB, then cells from lymph nodes, spleen and blood rapidly isolated and fixed, and antibodies specific for phosphorylated c-jun used to analyze its phosphorylation.
11686
11822
In addition, cells were stained with antibodies specific to Vβ8 or Vβ6 to detect SEB responsive and non-responsive T cells respectively.
11823
11891
Flow cytometry was employed to detect phosphorylation of c-jun [30].
11892
11924
Figure 5 demonstrates that 1 hr.
11925
12062
after intravenous exposure to SEB, Vβ8+ SEB reactive T cells in spleen and lymph nodes contain higher levels of phosphorylated c-jun (cf.
12063
12068
Figs.
12069
12085
5a, b iii & iv).
12086
12161
Similar results were found in animals exposed to SEB i.p. (data not shown).
12162
12303
By contrast, T cells non-reactive to SEB in the same animals, those bearing Vβ6+ TcRs, did not have any increase in phosphorylated c-jun (cf.
12304
12309
Figs.
12310
12325
5a, b, i & ii).
12326
12577
This demonstrates that in the same animal, only those T cells that interact with and can be activated by SEB respond by phosphorylation of c-jun, while at the same time, those T cells that are not reactive are not activated, demonstrating specificity.
12578
12783
Similarly, animals injected with PBS showed no such change in phosphorylated c-jun in either the SEB reactive or non-reactive T cell populations, indicating that this was an SEB mediated event (Fig. 5a–b).
12784
12900
Other controls including secondary reagents alone demonstrate the specificity of antibody staining (data not shown).
12903
13023
We next determined whether T cells lacking ITK could induce c-jun phosphorylation in response to SEB activation in vivo.
13024
13220
ITK null mice were exposed to SEB as described above, and phosphorylation of c-jun determined in Vβ8+ T cell population (SEB reactive) or Vβ6+ T cell population (non-reactive) in the same animals.
13221
13358
These experiments show that in the absence of ITK, SEB does not lead to phosphorylation of c-jun in either T cell population (Fig. 6a–d).
13359
13501
Thus, the absence of ITK results in the lack of SEB phosphorylation of c-jun, which could affect the ability of these T cells to produce IL-2.
13502
13715
To determine if this lack of c-jun phosphorylation in ITK null T cells in response to SEB reflected global nonresponsiveness in these cells, we determined whether these cells were indeed activated by SEB exposure.
13716
13879
To do this, we measured increases in CD69 expression, a cell surface protein that is rapidly expressed by activated T cells in a Ras/MAPK dependent manner [31-33].
13880
14068
Similar experiments were performed as those examining c-jun phosphorylation, except that we used specific antibodies against CD69 to determine if the SEB reactive cells had been activated.
14069
14326
Figure 7 demonstrates that Vβ8+CD4+ T cells but not Vβ6+CD4+ T cells from both WT and ITK null mice exhibited increases in CD69 expression 2 hours following SEB exposure, indicating that in both cases, the T cells were responding to SEB activation (Fig. 7).
14327
14506
However, SEB induced CD69 expression on a higher percentage of Vβ8+CD4+ SEB responding T cells in WT mice than in ITK null mice (73.5 +/- 12% in WT vs. 43.6 +/- 0.5% in ITK null).
14507
14676
However, there was no difference in the MFI of CD69 expression WT responding T cells vs. ITK null responding T cells (362.5 _+/- 6.3 in WT vs. 375 +/- 11.3 in ITK null).
14677
14783
In addition, there was no difference in the expression of CD25 on WT or ITK null T cells (data not shown).
14784
14958
Thus the lack of SEB induced c-jun phosphorylation in ITK null T cells seems to reflect the specific role of ITK in regulating this event in response to SEB exposure in vivo.
14961
15038
Exposure of mice to SEB and LPS results in toxicity culminating in death [1].
15039
15112
We therefore analyzed the effect of exposure to SEB/LPS on ITK null mice.
15113
15235
However, in contrast to the results with IL-2 secretion and T cell expansion, both mice were affected similarly (Table 1).
15236
15487
Thus the same proportion of mice became sick following exposure to SEB and LPS, suggesting that although the absence of ITK affects IL-2 secretion following SEB exposure, its absence does not affect the ability of SEB to induce sickness in these mice.
15490
15500
Discussion
15502
15667
It is well established that exposure to SEB results in large scale cytokine production, which in part is responsible for symptoms of exposure to this toxin [1,2,35].
15668
15765
T cells have been shown to be largely responsible for this excessive cytokine production [35,36].
15766
15981
Current suggestions for pharmacologically blocking the symptoms of SEB exposure include T cell signal transduction inhibitors such as CsA and Perfenidone, however, these agents have significant side effects [37,38].
15982
16097
Here we present a promising target for inhibition IL-2 production induced by SEB exposure, the tyrosine kinase ITK.
16098
16220
We show that mice lacking ITK have significantly reduced T cell expansion and IL-2 secretion upon exposure to SEB in vivo.
16221
16576
Furthermore, we show that the SEB induced signaling pathway leading to c-jun phosphorylation, an indication of JNK pathway activation, is significantly reduced in ITK null T cells, although these T cells could respond to SEB activation by upregulating CD69, and there was no difference in the overall toxicity of SEB/LPS in these mice compared to WT mice.
16579
16795
Previous work performed in vitro suggests that ITK is required for the anti-TcR/CD3 antibody mediated activation of the transcription factor NFAT, via regulation of calcium influx into TcR stimulated T cells [19,39].
16796
16915
ITK null T cells also exhibit reduced AP-1 DNA binding activity when stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 antibodies [19].
16916
17031
It has also been shown that JNK activation lies in part downstream of ITK following TcR crosslinking in vitro [23].
17032
17298
However, these experiments were performed in vitro and it is not clear that effects seen in vitro would reflect what happens in vivo, since other cell-cell interactions may allow for activation of pathways that are not seen using in vitro activation with antibodies.
17299
17438
Our data however, suggest that indeed, ITK lies downstream of the TcR and is required for IL-2 secretion and c-jun phosphorylation in vivo.
17439
17639
Corroborating a role for c-jun activation in IL-2 production, mice carrying a dominant negative c-jun have much reduced IL-2 secretion in vitro [28] (mice lacking c-jun die during embryogenesis [40]).
17640
17721
Similarly, JNK has been implicated in IL-2 secretion by T cells in vitro [25-27].
17722
17841
Our data lend support to this idea that the JNK-c-jun pathway is involved in the production of IL-2 by T cells in vivo.
17844
18084
Curiously, the immunosuppresant CsA has been shown to inhibit the effects of SEB exposure in mice if delivered prior to SEB exposure [36], however it does not inhibit SEB induced effects in monkeys if delivered at the same time as SEB [38].
18085
18584
The effects of CsA on SEB induced symptoms has been suggested to be due to its effects on inhibiting IL-2 and other cytokine production due to inhibition of activation of the transcription factor NFAT [36,41], however, CsA also inhibits activation of the JNK pathway following TcR/CD3 and CD28 stimulation [29,30], and so CsA pretreatment may act to prevent early T cell activation of these pathways, thus blocking cytokine production and protecting mice from the effects of subsequent SEB exposure.
18587
18732
Mice lacking ITK exhibit reduced T cell responses in vitro, but also have reduced percentages of CD4+ T cells (approximately 60–70% of WT, [16]).
18733
18968
While this would be expected to reduced the overall T cell response in vivo to SEB exposure, if these cells were able to respond to SEB, we would expect an equivalent reduction in the amount of IL-2 secreted in vivo in response to SEB.
18969
19047
We would also expect to see an equivalent reduction in proliferation in vitro.
19048
19219
However, in vivo, we observed much reduced IL-2 secretion, and reduced expansion of Vβ8+CD4+ T cells, although this was not as dramatic as the reduction in IL-2 secretion.
19220
19396
Indeed, it has been observed that SEB induced T cell expansion in IL-2 null mice, indicating that IL-2 is not necessary for expansion of T cells in vivo following SEB exposure.
19397
19556
However, even with the reduced T cell responses observed in ITK null mice, they still suffer from SEB/LPS induced toxicity similar to that seen in the WT mice.
19557
19676
It should be noted however, that C57BL/6 mice are much less sensitive to SEB induce lethal shock than Balb/c mice [34].
19677
19780
Thus we observed very few deaths in our experiments, and ITK may protect Balb/c mice from actual death.
19781
19878
We are currently crossing these mice onto the Balb/c background to determine if this is the case.
19881
19891
Conclusion
19893
19998
In conclusion, we have show that ITK is required for IL-2 production induced by SEB in vivo and in vitro.
19999
20119
We have also shown that ITK may regulate signals leading IL-2 production in part by regulating phosphorylation of c-jun.
20120
20188
However, mice lacking ITK exhibit similar responses to SEB toxicity.
20189
20440
The data suggest that the inability of T cell lacking ITK to produce IL-2 cannot be overcome by SAG stimulation, and that perturbing T cell activation pathways leading to IL-2 production does not necessarily lead to improved responses to SEB toxicity.
20443
20450
Methods
20452
20569
Wild type mice and ITK-deficient mice (C57BL/6 background, [16]) between 8 and 10 weeks were used in all experiments.
20570
20694
RAG1-/- mice were a kind gift of Dr. Eric Harvill (Penn State University) and were similarly used between 6–10 weeks of age.
20695
20805
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Pennsylvania State University approved all experiments.
20808
21156
WT and ITK deficient mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 50 μg SEB in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and after 2 days, were sacrificed and splenocytes stained with antibodies specific for Vβ8 (SEB reactive T cells) or Vβ6 (non-reactive T cells) and CD4 directly conjugated to FITC and PE respectively (BDPharmingen, San Diego, CA).
21157
21248
Alternatively, mice were injected i.p. with 50 μg SEB and eye-bled every 2 days for 5 days.
21249
21357
Following lysis of red blood cells, the remaining cells were stained as described above for the splenocytes.
21358
21454
Lymphocytes were identified by flow cytometry by their forward and side scatter characteristics.
21457
21627
We used a protocol reported by Zell et al to determine the phosphorylation status of c-jun, as a measure of activation of the JNK-c-jun pathway in SEB responding T cells.
21628
21747
WT and ITK deficient mice were injected i.p. or intravenously (i.v.) with 50 μg SEB and allowed to survive for an 1 hr.
21748
21810
Similar results were found with both routes of administration.
21811
21978
Animals were sacrificed and spleens, lymph nodes, and blood rapidly isolated, and dounced in 2% paraformaldehyde to rapidly fix the cells as previously described [30].
21979
22117
Cells were stained with antibodies to Vβ8 or Vβ6 directly conjugated to PE (BDPharmingen, San Diego, CA), then permeabilized with saponin.
22118
22358
Cells were then stained for intracellular phosphorylated-c-jun with a monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated c-jun (IgG1, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), followed by biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG1 and streptavidin conjugated to FITC.
22359
22402
Controls included secondary reagents alone.
22403
22628
Upregulation of CD69 by SEB in vivo was performed using similar approaches, except that T cells were not fixed or permeabilized prior to staining with PE-conjugated anti-CD69 monoclonal antibody (BDPharmingen, San Diego, CA).
22629
22783
This was followed by analysis by flow cytometry, with post analysis performed using the WinMDI program 2.8 (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA).
22786
22866
Lymph nodes and spleens were isolated from WT and ITK deficient mice and pooled.
22867
22959
Red blood cells were removed using ACK lysis buffer, and cells resuspended in complete RPMI.
22960
23146
Cells were then left unstimulated or stimulated with varying concentrations of SEB (5 μg/ml, 0.5 μg/ml, 0.05 μg/ml, 0.005 μg/ml, and 0.0005 μg/ml) at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml.
23147
23279
These cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 days and pulsed once a day for 5 days with 0.5 μCi tritiated thymidine per well for 12 hrs.
23280
23295
before harvest.
