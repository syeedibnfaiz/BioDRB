Increased interleukin-17 production via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and nuclear factor κB-dependent pathway in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
151
159
Abstract
161
273
Inflammatory mediators have been recognized as being important in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
274
444
Interleukin (IL)-17 is an important regulator of immune and inflammatory responses, including the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and osteoclastic bone resorption.
445
575
Evidence for the expression and proinflammatory activity of IL-17 has been demonstrated in RA synovium and in animal models of RA.
576
750
Although some cytokines (IL-15 and IL-23) have been reported to regulate IL-17 production, the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate IL-17 production remain unknown.
751
894
In the present study, we investigated the role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in the regulation of IL-17 production in RA.
895
1126
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with RA (n = 24) were separated, then stimulated with various agents including anti-CD3, anti-CD28, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
1127
1254
IL-17 levels were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction.
1255
1392
The production of IL-17 was significantly increased in cells treated with anti-CD3 antibody with or without anti-CD28 and PHA (P < 0.05).
1393
1610
Among tested cytokines and chemokines, IL-15, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and IL-6 upregulated IL-17 production (P < 0.05), whereas tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, IL-18 or transforming growth factor-β did not.
1611
1746
IL-17 was also detected in the PBMC of patients with osteoarthritis, but their expression levels were much lower than those of RA PBMC.
1747
1912
Anti-CD3 antibody activated the PI3K/Akt pathway; activation of this pathway resulted in a pronounced augmentation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) DNA-binding activity.
1913
2115
IL-17 production by activated RA PBMC is completely or partly blocked in the presence of the NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and the PI3K/Akt inhibitor wortmannin and LY294002, respectively.
2116
2237
However, inhibition of activator protein-1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 did not affect IL-17 production.
2238
2406
These results suggest that signal transduction pathways dependent on PI3K/Akt and NF-κB are involved in the overproduction of the key inflammatory cytokine IL-17 in RA.
2408

Introduction
2422
2550
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by infiltrations of macrophages and T cells into the joint, and synovial hyperplasia.
2551
2668
Proinflammatory cytokines released from these cells are known to be important in the destruction of joints in RA [1].
2669
2923
The favorable clinical benefits obtained with inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) and interleukin (IL)-1 suggest that the blockade of key inflammatory cytokines has been the important issue in the development of new therapeutic applications [2].
2926
3116
A little over a decade ago, the primacy of T cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease such as RA was undisputed because they are the largest cell population infiltrating the synovium.
3117
3372
However, a series of studies demonstrated paucity of T cell-derived cytokines such as IL-2 and interferon-γ in the joints of RA, whereas macrophage and fibroblast cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, IL-15, IL-18 and TNF-α were abundant in rheumatoid synovium.
3373
3451
This paradox has questioned the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of RA [3].
3452
3703
Because we have already demonstrated the enhanced proliferation of antigen specific T cells, especially to type II collagen, and the skewing of T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines in RA [4], the role of T cells needs to be elucidated in different aspects.
3706
3837
IL-17 is one of the inflammatory cytokines secreted mainly by activated T cells, which can induce IL-6 and IL-8 by fibroblasts [5].
3838
4002
This cytokine is of interest for two major reasons: first, similarly to TNF-α and IL-1, IL-17 has proinflammatory properties; second, it is produced by T cells [6].
4003
4222
Recent observations demonstrated that IL-17 can also activate osteoclastic bone resorption by the induction of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB [NF-κB] ligand), which is involved in bony erosion in RA [7].
4223
4448
It also stimulates the production of IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor by synoviocytes, and of prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide by chondrocytes, and has the ability to differentiate and activate the dendritic cells [8-10].
4449
4633
Levels of IL-17 in synovial fluids were significantly higher in patients with RA than in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), and it was produced by CD4+ T cells in the synovium [11,12].
4636
4845
IL-15, secreted from activated macrophages, has been reported to be an important trigger of IL-17 production in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by cyclosporine and steroid sensitive pathways [13].
4846
4988
Recently, Happel and colleagues also showed that IL-23 could be an efficient trigger of IL-17 production from both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [14].
4991
5190
Although the contribution of IL-17 in joint inflammation in RA has been documented in earlier studies [12,15,16], the intracellular signal transduction pathway for IL-17 production remains uncertain.
5191
5335
In the present study we used various stimuli to investigate IL-17 production in PBMC of patients with RA and its signaling transduction pathway.
5338
5530
We found that the intracellular signaling pathway involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and NF-κB might be involved in the overproduction of the key inflammatory cytokine IL-17 in RA.
5531
5659
These results might provide new insights into the pathogenesis of RA and future directions for new therapeutic strategies in RA.

10046
10304
After washing, streptavidin–alkaline phosphate–horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) was incubated for 2 hours, then washed again and incubated with 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) dissolved in diethanolamine (Sigma) to develop the color reaction.
10305
10414
The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 M NaOH and the optical density of each well was read at 405 nm.
10415
10463
The lower limit of IL-17 detection was 10 pg/ml.
10464
10580
Recombinant human IL-17 diluted in culture medium was used as a calibration standard, ranging from 10 to 2000 pg/ml.
10581
10751
A standard curve was drawn by plotting optical density against the log of the concentration of recombinant cytokines, and used for determination of IL-17 in test samples.
10754
10872
PBMC were incubated with various concentrations of anti-CD3 in the presence or absence of inhibitors (LY294002, PDTC).
10873
11027
After 16 hours of incubation, mRNA was extracted with RNAzol B (Biotex Laboratories, Houston, TX, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
11028
11169
Reverse transcription of 2 μg of total mRNA was performed at 42°C using the Superscript™ reverse transcription system (Takara, Shiga, Japan).
11170
11323
PCR amplification of cDNA aliquots was performed by adding 2.5 mM dNTPs, 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) and 0.25 μM of sense and antisense primers.
11324
11442
The reaction was performed in PCR buffer (1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3) in a total volume of 25 μl.
11443
11762
The following sense and antisense primers for each molecules were used: IL-17 sense, 5'-ATG ACT CCT GGG AAG ACC TCA TTG-3'; IL-17 antisense, 5'-TTA GGC CAC ATG GTG GAC AAT CGG-3'; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) sense, 5'-CGA TGC TGG GCG TGA GTA C-3'; GAPDH antisense, 5'-CGT TCA GCT CAG GGA TGA CC-3'.

11989
12154
PCR rounds were repeated for 25 cycles each for both GAPDH and IL-17; this was determined as falling within the exponential phase of amplification for each molecule.

Results
15077
15274
PBMC were separated and cultured with PHA (5 μg/ml) from patients with RA, patients with OA, and age-matched normal controls; IL-17 levels were then determined in the culture supernatants (Fig. 1).
15275
15614
Although the amounts of basal IL-17 secretion were not different between RA, OA and normal controls (62 ± 31, 43 ± 19 and 43 ± 10 pg/ml, respectively), the IL-17 production stimulated by PHA was significantly higher in RA PBMC than in those from OA and controls (768 ± 295 versus 463 ± 211 pg/ml [P < 0.05] and 241 ± 29 pg/ml [P < 0.001]).
15617
15897
Because IL-17 was already known from earlier reports to be produced mainly by activated T cells, we investigated the effect of different concentrations of anti-CD3 (1, 5 and 10 μg/ml) as a T cell activation, which showed a dose-dependent increase in IL-17 levels (data not shown).
15898
15982
On the basis of this, we chose 10 μg/ml as a stimulation concentration for anti-CD3.
15983
16166
As shown in Table 1, anti-CD3 significantly upregulated IL-17 production up to 3.7-fold, and the combination of anti-CD28 and anti-CD3 produced more IL-17 (approximately 1.3-1.5-fold)
16167
16187
than anti-CD3 alone.
16188
16372
Furthermore, when incubated with T cell mitogens such as PHA, increased IL-17 production was more pronounced than with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (588 ± 85 versus 211 ± 1 pg/ml; P < 0.05).
16375
16575
Because RA PBMC include several cell types in addition to T cells, some inflammatory cytokines released from macrophages and other lymphocytes might have affected the production of IL-17 from T cells.
16576
16732
To evaluate the effects of inflammatory cytokines released by activated PBMC, we tested the effects of several cytokines and chemokines on IL-17 production.
16733
16944
We detected an increase in IL-17 level after stimulation with IL-15 (10 ng/ml), whereas with IL-1β (10 ng/ml), TNF-α (10 ng/ml), IL-18 (10 ng/ml) or TGF-β (10 ng/ml) the levels in IL-17 were unchanged (Fig. 2a).
16945
17223
When treated with MCP-1 (10 ng/ml) or IL-6 (10 ng/ml), significant upregulations of IL-17 proteins were observed (62 ± 42 and 50 ± 10 versus 31 ± 11 pg/ml, respectively; P < 0.05), whereas none was observed with IL-8 (10 ng/ml), MIP-1α (10 ng/ml) or MIP-1β (10 ng/ml) (Fig. 2b).
17226
17359
Having observed the increased IL-17 production in RA PBMC, it was important to know which signal transduction pathways were involved.
17360
17623
As illustrated in Fig. 3, an significant decrease in anti-CD3-induced IL-17 production was observed when co-incubated with NF-κB inhibitor, PDTC and dexamethasone in comparison with anti-CD3 alone (38 ± 5 and 54 ± 11 versus 98 ± 19 pg/ml, respectively; P < 0.05).
17626
17834
LY294002 and wortmannin, as an inhibitor of PI3K, also markedly inhibited the anti-CD3-induced IL-17 production in RA PBMC (98 ± 19 versus 38 ± 10 pg/ml [P < 0.005] and 48 ± 4 pg/ml [P < 0.05], respectively).
17837
18079
The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK506 also downregulated the IL-17 secretion as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 inhibitor SB203580 did, whereas rapamycin and PD98059 had no effect on IL-17 levels (Fig. 3).
18080
18269
To evaluate the possibility of non-specific inhibition by the drug at high concentrations, we observed the dose response of PDTC and LY294002 for the inhibition of IL-17 production in PBMC.
18270
18363
There were dose-dependent inhibitions of IL-17 production with chemical inhibitors (Fig. 4a).
18364
18456
The other inhibitors in addition to PDTC and LY294002 showed the same pattern of inhibition.
18457
18569
Cytotoxic effects on PBMC by the chemical inhibitors at experimental concentrations were not observed (Fig. 4b).
18572
18740
To see whether enhanced IL-17 production could be regulated at a transcriptional level, semi-quantatitive reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction was performed.
18741
18929
We observed a dose-dependent increase in IL-17 mRNA transcripts after stimulation with anti-CD3; this was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and by the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC (Fig. 5).
18932
19051
To determine downstream effector molecules of the PI3K pathway, we evaluated the activation of Akt by western blotting.
19052
19206
As shown in Fig. 6, at 10 min of incubation with anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) or LY294002 (20 μM), no difference in the amounts of phosphorylated Akt was observed.
19207
19382
However, after 30 min of incubation, phosphorylated Akt increased (lane 2), and the effect of inhibition by LY294002 (lane 3) reached a peak at 60 min, lasting to 120–240 min.
19383
19480
In contrast, non-phosphorylated Akt and β-actin remained unchanged regardless of incubation time.
19481
19678
PHA, concanavalin A and IL-15 also demonstrated the same effect on phosphorylated Akt as shown with anti-CD3, which was an inhibition by wortmannin and PDTC as well as by LY294002 (data not shown).
19681
19969
To investigate further the intracellular signaling pathway activated by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28, concanavalin A, PHA and IL-15, and responsible for inducing IL-17 expression, we performed an electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA) of NF-κB recognition sites in the promoters of IL-17.
19970
20174
As shown in Fig. 7a, nuclear extracts from RA PBMC stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (lane 2) demonstrated increased binding of NF-κB to IL-17 promoters in comparison with that of controls (lane 1).
20175
20274
A supershift assay demonstrated shifted bands in p65 and p50 (lanes 3 and 4) not in c-Rel (lane 5).
20275
20431
In normal PBMC the same pattern was observed, but the degree of NF-κB activation by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 was less intense than that in RA PBMC (Fig. 7b).
20432
20587
To confirm the link between PI3K activity and NF-κB, we performed EMSA to determine the NF-κB binding activity after treatment with both LY294002 and PDTC.
20588
20665
Both agents block NF-κB DNA-binding activity in the IL-17 promoter (Fig. 7c).
20666
20783
Western blotting for IκB-α showed inhibition of degradation of IκB-α by LY294002 and PDTC at the same time (Fig. 7c).
20784
21023
In contrast, the AP-1 pathway was not activated by stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (data not shown), demonstrating that NF-κB is the main intracellular signaling pathway in IL-17 production by activated PBMC from patients with RA.
21026

Discussion
21038
21123
IL-17 was first described as a T cell product with proinflammatory properties [5,22].
21124
21238
RA is characterized by hyperplasia of synovial lining cells and an intense infiltration by mononuclear cells [23].
21239
21455
Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α are abundant in rheumatoid synovium, whereas the T cell-derived cytokines, especially IL-4 and interferon-γ, have often proved difficult to detect in RA synovium [24].
21456
21610
Although T cells may have a role in the augmentation of rheumatoid synovial inflammation, the lack of T cell-derived cytokines has limited its importance.
21611

In this respect, IL-17 is appealing because it has been described as a T cell-derived cytokine with proinflammatory properties.
21741
21860
In our studies, we tried to evaluate how IL-17 production is regulated in RA PBMC, and which signaling pathway it used.
21861
21953
Levels of IL-17 were found to be higher in RA synovial fluid than in OA synovial fluid [15].
21954
22170
However, there are few data available on the agents that stimulate IL-17 production in RA, although the highest level of IL-17 production can be achieved by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation in healthy individuals [25].
22171
22348
In our experiments, PHA as mitogens, as well as anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for signaling through the T cell receptor, increased IL-17 production from RA PBMC in a dose-dependent manner.
22349
22521
We found, by a cell proliferation assay (data not shown), that this upregulation of IL-17 might be due to increased cellular activity rather than to cellular proliferation.
22524
22633
IL-17 is produced mainly by activated CD4+ T cells, especially for Th1/Th0 cells, not the Th2 phenotype [26].
22634
22759
However, it can also be produced by CD8+ T cells via an IL-23 triggering mechanism in Gram-negative pulmonary infection [14].
22760
22901
In addition, IL-17 production was significantly augmented by T cells recognizing type II collagen in a collagen-induced arthritis model [27].
22902
23075
A complex interaction between cells in inflamed RA joints might produce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which also activate other cells in the joints.
23076
23270
For example, IL-17 stimulates rheumatoid synoviocytes to secrete several cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 as well as prostaglandin E2 in vitro [12,28,29].
23271
23455
There are as yet few data available on the agents that stimulate IL-17 production in RA, although some cytokines (IL-15 and IL-23) have been known to regulate IL-17 production [13,14].
23456
23654
We therefore investigated the in vitro production of IL-17 in RA PBMC responding to a variety of cytokines/chemokines and mitogens as well as T cell receptor (TCR) ligation using anti-CD3/anti-CD28.
23655
23784
Our studies demonstrated that IL-15 and MCP-1 as well as TCR ligation significantly increased the production of IL-17 in RA PBMC.
23785
23864
Adding IL-15 or MCP-1 to TCR ligation augmented IL-17 production more markedly.
23865
24011
In contrast, IL-1 and TNF-α, which are known to have proinflammatory properties and to be increased in RA joints, did not affect IL-17 production.
24012
24143
Our data were consistent with a recent report that IL-15 triggered in vitro IL-17 production in PBMC, but TNF-α did not do so [13].
24144
24329
Although there were no data that MCP-1 directly induces T cell activation, it might exert effects indirectly on T cells through the activation of monocytes/macrophages in PBMC cultures.
24330
24458
As reported for normal individuals [25], T cell activation through anti-CD3/anti-CD28 also increases IL-17 induction in RA PBMC.
24461
24680
Although the signaling pathway for the induction of cytokines/chemokines by IL-17 has been documented widely [8,30,31], no data have been available on how IL-17 production can be regulated by certain signaling pathways.
24681
24825
By using signal transduction inhibitors, we therefore examined which signaling pathway was mainly involved in the induction of IL-17 in RA PBMC.
24828
25040
We identified that anti-CD3-induced IL-17 production in RA PBMC was significantly hampered by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC to comparable levels of basal production without stimulation.
25041
25162
We also found that anti-CD3-induced IL-17 production was downregulated by the addition of SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor.
25163
25248
It is interesting that a series of evidence supports crosstalk between NF-κB and p38.
25249
25417
In myocytes, IκB kinase-β is activated by p38 [32], and the activated p38 can stimulate NF-κB by a mechanism involving histone acetylase p300/CREB-binding protein [33].
25418
25634
Our results revealed that p38 MAPK activation was not affected by LY294002, whereas NF-κB binding activity was decreased by LY294002, which provided the evidence for a p38 MAPK pathway independent of PI3K activation.
25635
25744
The direct relationship between p38 and NF-κB for IL-17 production needs to be studied in future experiments.
25747
25895
The search for a downstream pathway of PI3K seemed to have a maximal response of Akt activation at 1 hour and a gradual loss of activity at 2 hours.
25896
26032
The fact that Akt is phosphorylated upon anti-CD3 stimulation suggests the possible involvement of PI3K in the induction of IL-17 in RA.
26033
26248
In view of the fact that NF-κB was also activated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28, IL-15 or mitogens in our experiments, it is most likely that the NF-κB pathway is also actively involved in the induction of IL-17 in RA PBMC.
26249
26416
In contrast, the AP-1 signal transduction pathway, another important signaling pathway for cytokines/chemokines, was not activated in our experiments (data not shown).
26417
26606
Although PI3K and its downstream kinase Akt in association with NF-κB have been reported to deliver activating signals in many cell types, the data on the signal inducing IL-17 are lacking.
26607
26882
Our data clearly demonstrated that PI3K/Akt and resultant NF-κB activation could be an important arbitrator of the upregulation of IL-17 in RA, on the basis of our experiments showing simultaneous blocking of NF-κB binding activity in the IL-17 promoter by PDTC and LY294002.
26883
27131
Considering its proinflammatory activities and successful induction of anti-IL-17 for ameliorating arthritis in animal models [2,6,34-36], understanding the IL-17 signaling pathway is an important element of developing new targeted therapies in RA.
27134
27145
Conclusions
27147
27291
We have detected a more pronounced production of IL-17 from RA PBMC in response to IL-15 and MCP-1 as well as stimulation by anti-CD3/anti-CD28.
27292
27470
We have also shown that upregulation of IL-17 by activated T cells in patients with RA could be the result of activation via the PI3K/Akt pathway with resultant NF-κB activation.
27471
27655
Our data provide insights into cellular mechanisms of the regulation of IL-17 production in RA, and highlight the role of T cells, which has hitherto been neglected in RA pathogenesis.
27656
27842
Together with recent data on the successful introduction of anti-IL-17 in RA, our results have added information for the future molecular targeting of new therapeutic applications in RA.
