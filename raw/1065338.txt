Abstract
112
300
Naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells mediate immune suppression to limit immunopathogenesis associated with chronic inflammation, persistent infections and autoimmune diseases.
301
463
Their mode of suppression is contact-dependent, antigen-nonspecific and involves a nonredundant contribution from the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-β.
464
723
Not only can TGF-β mediate cell–cell suppression between the regulatory T cells and CD4+CD25- or CD8+ T cells, but new evidence also reveals its role in the conversion of CD4+CD25- T cells, together with TCR antigen stimulation, into the regulatory phenotype.
724
832
Elemental to this conversion process is induction of expression of the forkhead transcription factor, Foxp3.
833
1191
This context-dependent coercion of naive CD4+ T cells into a powerful subset of regulatory cells provides a window into potential manipulation of these cells to orchestrate therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by inadequate suppression, as well as a promising means of controlling pathologic situations in which excessive suppression dominates.

Introduction
1207
1367
Autoimmune diseases are characterized by a loss of regulation of T cell growth and activation, with resultant overexuberant inflammation and tissue destruction.
1368
1570
Although T cell responses to foreign antigens are essential to our protection from a plethora of potentially pathogenic agents and microbes, T cell responses to self antigens can be overtly deleterious.
1571
1822
As the signaling pathways associated with T cell activation continue to be illuminated, there is also an emerging excitement about naturally occurring opposing forces that can exert control over antigen-activated T cells to prevent reactivity to self.
1823
2101
Suppressor T cells, implicated in this regulatory process decades ago, fell into ill repute but have recently re-emerged not only as a real population but as a population crucial to immune homeostasis, maintenance of tolerance, and prevention of the onset of autoimmune disease.
2102
2274
Their existence is no longer in question, but true to their history these cells, their origin, generation, and mechanisms of action have generated considerable controversy.
2275
2607
Recognition of the potential impact of these cells in clinical cellular therapy has driven a rapid expansion of the field in order to understand and manipulate the regulatory T cell population to devise strategies to control autoimmunity, transplantation tolerance, tumor immunity, allergy and infectious diseases, particularly HIV.
2610
2893
One of the most intensely studied of the heterogeneous family of regulatory T cells is a population of CD4+ T cells constitutively expressing CD25 (IL-2Rα), found in thymus and in peripheral lymphoid organs, and comprising 5 to 10% of the total CD4+ T cells in mice and humans [1-5].
2894
3044
On the basis of their unique functional properties, this small but powerful population of T cells has been dubbed CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg).
3045
3151
In contrast to CD4+CD25- T cells, freshly isolated CD4+CD25+ Treg are anergic to TCR stimulation in vitro.
3152
3380
However, once activated, these Treg are robust suppressors and can mediate the inhibition of CD4+CD25- responder T cells by means of a cell-contact-dependent mechanism involving transforming growth factor (TGF)-β [6-9] (Fig. 1).
3381
3564
Although the role of TGF-β has not yet been universally accepted [10,11], the preponderance of evidence has solidified a contribution from TGF-β in the regulatory process [6-8,12-15].
3567
3840
The essentiality of this endogenous population in protecting the host from disproportionate T cell activation and autoreactive effector cells is underscored both in experimental models and in humans in which the numbers and/or function of Treg are compromised [6,10,16-20].
3841
4103
In mice, depletion of CD4+CD25+ T cells by neonatal (day 3) thymectomy leads to spontaneous development of organ-specific autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroiditis, gastritis, and wasting [19], which can be reversed by adoptive transfer of Treg [21].
4104
4276
Treg are pivotal in the protection of lymphopenic mice from induced inflammatory bowel disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, diabetes, and allergy [16,18,22].
4277
4398
In infectious models, Treg also influence the effector immune response, as is evident in Leishmania major infection [20].
4401
4471
Both innate and adaptive immune responses are subject to Treg control.
4472
4694
Triggering of dendritic cells by Toll-like receptor ligands expressed by invading pathogens leads to the production of soluble factors, including IL-6, that may render effector cells refractory to regulatory activity [23].
4695
4803
Moreover, activated dendritic cells produce TGF-β, which may further influence the development of Treg [24].
4804
5033
By such intersecting pathways, the innate and regulatory arms of the immune system have the capacity to exert sufficient control over each other to enable effector cells to mount efficient immune responses with minimal pathology.
5034
5145
In human infectious, neoplastic, and autoimmune diseases, Treg activities often mirror those in murine systems.
5146
5331
Numbers of Treg are reportedly reduced in human autoimmune diseases [17,25], although their significance in the evolution of immunopathogenesis remains an area of continued exploration.
5332
5568
Moreover, increased CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells have been reported in HIV-1 immunodeficiency [26], and in lung cancer patients the increased numbers of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells directly inhibit autologous T cell proliferation [27].
5569
5736
Thus, this unique and persuasive population of regulatory T cells has a crucial role in the maintenance of tolerance and immune homeostasis through immune suppression.
5739
5768
Mechanism of Treg suppression
5770
5834
Treg are both anergic, at least in vitro, and immunosuppressive.
5835
5941
The absence of Treg results in the breakdown of tolerance and the development of autoimmune diseases [28].
5942
6054
Our understanding of the functional domain of these cells has rapidly advanced through cell culture experiments.
6055
6255
In vitro, the ability of CD4+CD25+ Treg to suppress responder T cell proliferation and cytokine production requires their activation, is dependent on cell contact, and is antigen nonspecific [1,6,10].
6256
6462
After years of searching for the elusive mediator(s) of suppression consistent with the accepted cell-contact-dependent mechanism, membrane-associated TGF-β was identified as a pivotal perpetrator [6,7,14].
6463
6621
In this regard, latent TGF-β was first reported to be constitutively present on the surface of Treg [6,7]; subsequently, active TGF-β was identified [6,8,14].
6622
6864
In vitro stimulation with anti-CD3 and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) enhances membrane-bound active TGF-β, which is consistent with the requirement that Treg activation promotes their suppressive potential [6,13] (W Chen, unpublished data).
6865
7146
Blockade of cell-surface TGF-β with neutralizing antibodies, with soluble TGF-β receptor, or with recombinant latency-associated peptide disrupts the ability of these cells to block responder T cell proliferation, confirming TGF-β as an instrument of suppression [6-8,12,13,15,29].
7147
7265
Still missing was the connecting link by which membrane-bound TGF-β could interact with the CD4+CD25- responder cells.
7266
7527
Recently, TGF-β receptor type II (TβRII) was detected at elevated levels on responder T cells once they were activated through their TCR, thereby providing the molecular bridge by which TGF-β on the Treg orchestrates suppression of the responder cells [6,8,12].
7530
7560
TGF-β signaling and regulation
7562
7957
TGF-β is a potent cytokine and growth factor whose biological activity is primarily regulated post-translationally [30], because it is transcribed and translated as a small latent complex composed not only of active TGF-β, but also of a latency-associated peptide (LAP) to which it is noncovalently bound and which prevents its interaction with its specific receptors on the target cell surface.
7958
8149
This small latent complex can be associated with the latent TGF-β1-binding protein, forming a large latent complex thought to serve as a tether for binding proteins and matrix molecules [31].
8150
8321
In this configuration, TGF-β is not active but requires cleavage or dissociation from LAP to enable its interaction with its cognate receptor complex, TβRII and TβRI [32].
8322
8563
Activation of TGF-β can occur by any of a number of mechanisms including cleavage with plasmin [33], interaction with αvβ6 [34], or through an ill-defined interaction of LAP with thrombospondin I (TSP-I), a ligand for the CD36 receptor [35].
8564
8853
Adding credence to a role for TSP-1, the TSP-1-null mice exhibit persistent inflammation, particularly in the pancreas and lung, and display a phenotype with similarities to TGF-β-null mice [36,37], although to a lesser extent because alternative mechanisms of TGF-β activation compensate.
8854
9028
Nonetheless, TSP-1 is a major activator of TGF-β1 in vivo [36], and a TSP peptide that activates TGF-β reverses the TSP-1-null phenotype by dampening the tissue inflammation.
9029
9327
In a feedback loop, TGF-β augments TSP secretion by dendritic cells and macrophages, and TGF-β-treated APCs facilitate the generation of regulatory T cells [38], creating an environment favorable for the induction of suppression and/or tolerance to ensure the blunting of any inflammatory reaction.
9330
9445
Often seeming paradoxical, activated TGF-β has both stimulatory and inhibitory influences on T cell function [6,8].
9446
9675
These apparently disparate effects are dependent on context, including state of differentiation, presence of other growth factors or cytokines, matrix molecules, additional proximal cell populations, and membrane receptor levels.
9676
9902
Beyond its involvement in contact-dependent suppression, soluble TGF-β can directly inhibit T cell proliferation, suppress macrophage activation and modulate dendritic cell function in its role as an immunoregulatory cytokine.
9903
10021
Deletion of this cytokine is associated with lethal immune dysregulation and multi-organ inflammatory disease [39,40].
10024
10163
In mediating its suppressive effects, TGF-β signals through the type I and type II TGF-β serine–threonine kinase receptors, TβRI and TβRII.
10164
10347
Interaction of the TGF-β ligand with these receptors on target cells engages a signaling cascade precipitated by the phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins identified as Smads [41,42].
10348
10660
When CD4+CD25+ Treg are co-cultured with TCR-activated CD4+CD25- responder T cells, there is a rapid engagement of this intracellular signaling pathway that is consistent with TGF-β as the link between these two cells and the impending functional inhibition manifested in the responder cell population [6,12,15].
10661
10929
In this regard, phosphorylation of Smads, initially detected with antibodies that recognize both Smad2 and Smad3 [6] (W Chen, unpublished data), and more recently with Smad2-specific antibodies [15], occurred within minutes after exposure of responder T cells to Treg.
10930
11102
Smad2 and Smad3 serve as receptor-activated Smad signaling intermediates, whereas Smad4 is a common Smad that complexes with Smad2/3 to enable translocation to the nucleus.
11103
11430
Once within the nucleus, the Smad complex may interact with specific DNA sequences and with multiple specific transcription factors, in addition to transcriptional coactivators and/or co-repressors, culminating in the transcription of target genes and the transduction of a variety of signals dependent on the target cell [41].
11431
11622
Smad2/3 are anchored to the plasma membrane through the Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA), which probably increases the efficiency of activation by the TGF-β-receptor complexes [43].
11623
11897
Smad2, rather than Smad3, may be the critical connector in the intracellular signaling pathway engaged in the responder cells by Treg surface-bound TGF-β, because mice deficient in Smad3 respond to Treg suppression and also to exogenous TGF-β [6] (W Chen, unpublished data).
11898
12017
In addition to that mediated by Smad2, TGF-β signaling is regulated by complex mechanisms in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
12018
12226
Beyond engaging Smad activity, TGF-β triggers the extracellular signal-related kinase and p38 mitogen-activated kinase pathways [44] to link additional signaling cascades involved in modulating cell function.
12229
12540
Perturbations in this immunoregulatory circuit can occur through dysregulation of the inhibitory Smad, Smad7, which typically represses TGF-β signaling by interacting with activated TGF-β receptors to prevent the activation of Smad2/3 and/or by interfering with complex formation between Smad2/3 and Smad4 [45].
12541
12727
Facilitating the inhibitory Smad signals are the Smad ubiquitin regulatory factors (Smurfs), E3 ubiquitin ligases, capable of inducing polyubiquitination and degradation of TβRI [46,47].
12728
12839
Smad7 is inducible by TGF-β itself as part of a feedback loop, as well as by the IFN-γ and NF-κB pathways [41].
12840
13108
Moreover, the transcriptional co-repressors c-Ski and SnoN, by means of their interactions with Smad2/3/4, repress TGF-β-induced transcription and are upregulated by TGF-β as another negative feedback loop to maintain control of this incredibly powerful molecule [41].
13109
13252
Dissection of these circuits will probably reveal pathways by which suppression can be manipulated to orchestrate changes in aberrant immunity.
13255
13564
Although the preponderance of evidence supports a major role for TGF-β in the mediation of Treg suppressive activity, there are likely to be additional factors and/or cofactors that secondarily contribute to their function and that may become prevalent in the absence of TGF-β and/or if TGF-β is dysregulated.
13565
13645
The identification and intersection points of such pathways await further study.
13646
13875
Among the factors that contribute to the regulation of TGF-β in CD4+CD25+ Treg are CD28, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4, glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor and forkhead/winged helix or forkhead box P3 encoded by Foxp3 [48-51].
13878
13896
Generation of Treg
13898
14265
Although Treg were originally considered to derive only from thymic precursors [1], to be exported to the periphery, and to represent less than 10% of CD4+ T cells [52], thereby limiting their potential for manipulation for therapeutic considerations, important new evidence documents that Treg can be expanded and/or induced de novo from CD4+CD25- precursor T cells.
14266
14386
How, where, and if the size and function of this population can be intentionally controlled is of the utmost importance.
14387
14524
The thymic derivation of Treg is genetically as well as developmentally regulated, but it seems to be constitutive and relatively stable.
14525
14633
Recruitment to a site of autoimmune reactivity may increase their numbers locally, but in a limited fashion.
14634
14758
The ability to coerce expansion of functional Treg opens up possibilities for the manipulation of inflammation and immunity.
14759
14900
CD4+CD25+ Treg undergo proliferation with TCR stimulation in the presence of high doses of exogenous IL-2 (more than 100 U/ml) in vitro [10].
14901
15041
Importantly, these expanded CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells preserve their anergic features and immunosuppressive ability once IL-2 is removed.
15042
15209
This unique aspect of CD4+CD25+ Treg has definite potential application in designing future clinical therapy for autoimmune diseases, inflammation and transplantation.
15210
15431
Nonetheless, the insufficiency of naturally derived CD4+CD25+ Treg in autoimmunity and other immune diseases has driven the search for approaches to convert normal naive CD4+CD25-T cells into CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells.
15434
15625
The generation of functionally uncompromised CD4+CD25+ Treg involves the unique induction of forkhead/winged helix transcription factor Foxp3 (Scurfin) in Foxp3-negative CD4+CD25- precursors.
15626
15775
Foxp3 is highly conserved, and in both mice and humans genetically defective Foxp3 is associated with autoimmune and inflammatory disease [48,53-57].
15776
15880
In Foxp3 null mice, the deficiency of CD4+CD25+ Treg results in a lethal autoimmune syndrome [53,55,57].
15881
16097
In vitro, gene transfer of Foxp3 converts naive CD4+CD25- T cells into phenotypic and functional Treg [48,53,55,56], which is consistent with the ability to rescue Foxp3-null mice with adoptive transfer of Treg [55].
16098
16213
These data support the pivotal and nonredundant role of this transcription factor in Treg development and function.
16214
16478
Conversely, the overexpression of Foxp3 in a transgenic mouse model results in enhanced numbers of CD4+CD25+ Treg and, furthermore, Foxp3-expressing CD4+CD25-, as well as CD4-CD8+, T cells in these transgenic mice constitutively exhibit suppressive functions [57].
16481
16692
Despite the success of the artificial gene transfer of Foxp3 into CD4+CD25- naive T cells to coerce them into a CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell phenotype, the existence of a physiologic inducer of Foxp3 was unknown.
16693
16843
The recent elucidation of a signaling pathway leading to the conversion of CD4+CD25- precursors into Treg revealed a pivotal role for TGF-β [8,12,14].
16844
17011
Moreover, the genetic deletion of Foxp3 results in an overlapping phenotype with the TGF-β1-null mice [40], implicating a connection and/or shared mechanism of action.
17012
17138
The induction of gene expression of Foxp3, a transcription factor unique to Treg [48,53-57] is, in fact, TGF-β dependent [12].
17139
17273
However, TGF-β cannot act independently on precursor cells to generate Treg but requires co-stimulation through TCR and IL-2R [12,58].
17274
17476
Naive splenic CD4+CD25- T cells cultured for 7 to 9 days with TCR stimulation and TGF-β in the presence of APCs emerge as CD4+CD25+ Treg with the ability to suppress CD4+ responder T cell proliferation.
17477
17635
A similar conversion pattern occurs in TCR transgenic mice if the CD4+CD25- naive T cells are stimulated with specific antigen and APCs with TGF-β added [12].
17636
17859
This engagement of the TCR and co-stimulator molecules (such as CD28) [49,50,59,60] in concert with TβRII ligation triggers signaling pathways that culminate in Foxp3 transcription, which is essential to generation of Treg.
17860
17962
In this fashion, TGF-β is not only expressed by Treg but also programs their development and function.
17965
18018
TGF-β-converted Treg control immune responses in vivo
18020
18247
On the basis of this understanding of the novel mechanism underlying conversion of CD4+CD25- T cells into phenotypic and functional CD4+CD25+ Treg, the expansion of Treg for therapeutic consideration becomes an achievable goal.
18248
18377
Provided that the regulatory conditions are met, the converted CD4+CD25+ Treg function like conventional Treg, at least in vitro.
18378
18621
Although it has previously been shown that naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ Treg are potent inhibitors of innate/adaptive immunity [61-63], induction of a population of Treg and documentation of their in vivo potential was an important next step.
18622
18801
In pursuit of this goal, recent studies demonstrated for the first time that the transfer of in vitro generated Treg into disease models does in fact ameliorate pathogenesis [12].
18802
19043
Initially, it was shown that adoptive transfer of in vitro TGF-β-converted Treg together with ovalbumin-specific TCR transgenic T cells resulted in a profound inhibition of antigen-specific expansion of naive CD4+ transgenic T cells in vivo.
19044
19109
Although the TGF-β-converted CD25+ suppressor population (DO11.10
19110
19483
TCR transgenic, KJ1-26+) proliferated in vivo on immunization with ovalbumin peptide, the recovered KJ1-26+ CD4+ T cells from draining lymph nodes remained unresponsive to re-challenge with ovalbumin peptide in vitro, produced no antigen-specific IL-4 and IFN-γ, and expressed high levels of CD25 [12], all consistent with professional CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells [64,65].
19484
19696
Moreover, in a dramatic turnaround of allergen-induced asthmatic lung disease, TGF-β-converted/induced Treg, when transferred to an asthmatic mouse, suppressed allergen-induced inflammation and pathogenesis [12].
19697
19895
In this model, mice are immunized with house dust mite and then challenged intratracheally with house dust mite to induce airway hyperreactivity, mucus accumulation, eosinophilia and IgE production.
19896
20142
Delivery of Treg to these asthmatic mice on day 0 and 14 was able to prevent the immunopathogenic response (Fig. 2), confirming the functional prowess of these newly converted cells in the suppression of inflammatory and immune responses in vivo.
20145
20172
Treg in autoimmune diseases
20174
20302
Human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and murine models of SLE manifest a wide range of immunological abnormalities.
20303
20383
The most pervasive of these include the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies.
20384
20652
In this regard, 98% of human SLE patients possess antinuclear antibodies and 50 to 80% of these have anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, the result of unchecked B lymphocyte activation and antibody production, probably due to uncontrolled T cell hyper-responsiveness.
20653
20851
Both Th1 and Th2 responses are elevated, as demonstrated by the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, notably IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-10, as well as T cell-dependent autoantibody production.
20852
20999
Interestingly, these T and B lymphocyte abnormalities have been attributed, at least partly, to defective production and function of TGF-β [12,66].
21000
21198
In contrast to strong suspicions, few data yet exist as to whether the uncontrolled T and B cell activation and pathogenesis in SLE can be attributed to a deficiency in CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells.
21199
21537
In this regard, one study indicated that CD4+CD25+ T cells were significantly decreased in patients with active SLE in comparison with normal subjects and patients with an inactive stage of the disease [67], and in another recent study [68] Treg were reported to be abnormal in number, phenotype, and function in patients with active SLE.
21538
21759
However, the exact role of the decreased CD4+CD25+ Treg levels in the pathogenesis of SLE awaits demonstration of a significant correlation between the levels of CD4+CD25+ Treg and inactive disease or flare activity [69].
21762
21903
In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the relationship between CD4+CD25+ Treg and Th1-dependent pathogenesis of the disease also remains under study.
21904
22131
It was recently suggested [70] that no significant difference in suppressive activity was found between CD4+CD25+ T cells from peripheral blood of RA patients and healthy control subjects, although the numbers may be less [25].
22132
22288
Nonetheless, CD4+CD25+ T cells from synovial fluid reportedly had a significantly higher suppressive activity than those in peripheral blood of RA patients.
22289
22563
Notably, despite the presence of these highly functional Treg in synovial fluid, there was still ongoing inflammation in the joints, indicating the complex picture of RA pathogenesis, which might reflect a prominent imbalance between regulatory and inflammatory checkpoints.
22564
22911
In an encouraging experimental therapy study, patients with RA who were treated for 6 months with oral dnaJP1, a peptide that induces proinflammatory T cell responses in naive RA patients, manifested increased Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ T cells, suggesting that the treatment induced the emergence (enhancement) of T cells with the regulatory phenotype [71].
22912
23082
In short, despite the complex picture of Treg in autoimmunity, it can be envisioned that it will become feasible to manipulate regulatory T cells for therapeutic benefit.
23083
23282
With continued efforts, a better understanding and more advanced techniques will emerge for the induction and/or expansion of Treg to enhance their role in autoimmunity, allergy, and graft rejection.
23285
23295
Conclusion
23297
23498
Innate and adaptive immune responses are essential to protect the host from a plethora of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, but countermeasures to prevent reactivity of self are equally essential.
23499
23767
Although protection against self-recognition-induced autoimmunity is accomplished in large part by the central deletion of autoreactive T cells during intrathymic development, this process is not perfect and self-reactive escapees can wreak havoc on the immune system.
23768
23912
However, among the backup pathways in the periphery to protect us from self-destruction are deletion, anergy, ignorance, and active suppression.
23913
24086
Among these, current interest has zeroed in on CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells, which can profoundly suppress responder T cell proliferation and cytokines in vitro and in vivo.
24087
24297
Originally considered an exclusive product of the thymus, important new data indicate that these cells can be generated from peripheral CD4+ T cells and expanded for delivery as a cellular therapeutic strategy.
24298
24530
Opportunities to use suppressor T cell populations in the treatment of debilitating autoimmune diseases, allergy, chronic infectious diseases, and transplant rejection are no longer a dream of the future but are an emerging reality.
24531
24782
Moreover, as we illuminate the mechanisms of regulation of these Treg, it might also become feasible to diminish, rather than augment, their numbers/activity to promote tumor rejection and vaccine responses and/or to reverse immunodeficiency diseases.
